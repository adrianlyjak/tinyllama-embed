      "      \"abstract\": \"In the era of burgeoning electric vehicle (EV) popularity, understanding the patterns of EV users\\u2019 behavior is imperative. This paper examines the trends in household charging sessions\\u2019 timing, duration, and energy consumption by analyzing real-world residential charging data. By leveraging the information collected from each session, a novel framework is introduced for the efficient, real-time prediction of important charging characteristics. Utilizing historical data and user-specific features, machine learning models are trained to predict the connection duration, charging duration, charging demand, and time until the next session. These models enhance the understanding of EV users\\u2019 behavior and provide practical tools for optimizing the EV charging infrastructure and effectively managing the charging demand. As the transportation sector becomes increasingly electrified, this work aims to empower stakeholders with insights and reliable models, enabling them to anticipate the localized demand and contribute to the sustainable integration of electric vehicles into the grid.\",\n",

These attacks can cause significant harm to businesses and organizations by overwhelming their network resources, resulting in the unavailability of critical services. The traditional defense mechanisms, such as firewalls systems, are becoming insufficient to cope with the scale and complexity of DDoS attacks. In this research, we propose a new machine learning approach based on ensemble learning to detect DDoS attacks in cloud environments. The proposed method utilizes various features extracted from network traffic to train machine learning algorithms. The proposed solution is expected to be effective in detecting DDoS attacks in real-time with high accuracy.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"In tropical and subtropical areas, malaria stands as a profound public health challenge, causing an estimated 247 million cases worldwide annually. Given the absence of a viable vaccine, the timely and effective treatment of malaria remains a critical priority. However, the growing resistance of parasites to currently utilized drugs underscores the critical need for the identification of new antimalarial therapies. Here, we aimed to identify potential new drug candidates against Plasmodium falciparum, the main causative agent of malaria, by analyzing the transcriptomes of different life stages of the parasite and identifying highly expressed genes. We searched for genes that were expressed in all stages of the parasite\\u2019s life cycle, including the asexual blood stage, gametocyte stage, liver stage, and sexual stages in the insect vector, using transcriptomics data from publicly available databases. From this analysis, we found 674 overlapping genes, including 409 essential ones. By searching through drug target databases, we discovered 70 potential drug targets and 75 associated bioactive compounds. We sought to expand this analysis to similar compounds to known drugs. So, we found a list of 1557 similar compounds, which we predicted as actives and inactives using previously developed machine learning models against five life stages of Plasmodium spp. From this analysis, two compounds were selected, and the reactions were experimentally evaluated. The compounds HSP-990 and silvestrol aglycone showed potent inhibitory activity at nanomolar concentrations against the P. falciparum 3D7 strain asexual blood stage. Moreover, silvestrol aglycone exhibited low cytotoxicity in mammalian cells, transmission-blocking potential, and inhibitory activity comparable to those of established antimalarials. These findings warrant further investigation of silvestrol aglycone as a potential dual-acting antimalarial and transmission-blocking candidate for malaria control.\",\n",

This can also detect the emotions of students.

      "      \"abstract\": \"This work reports on the improved Q-switched and mode-locked performances of black titanium dioxide (BTiO2-x) nanoparticles embedded in thin-film composite material as a saturable absorber compared to TiO2 in an erbium-doped fiber laser. The thin-film saturable absorbers were prepared by mixing the nanoparticles with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as a host. BTiO2-x has a better nonlinear absorption coefficient, \\u03b2 of -12.46 x 10-7 m/W compared to -7.15x 10-7 m/W for TIO2 determined using z-scan measurement. The laser performance was evaluated in the 85.21 mW \\u2013 126.48 mW pump power range. Upon inserting TiO2 and BTiO2-x SA in a laser cavity, the peaks of the output spectrum shifted from 1566.62 nm to 1563.24 nm and 1565.75 nm, respectively. Regarding Q-switched performances, BTiO2-x SA generates a shorter pulse width of 16.00 \\u00b5s than TiO2 SA. The slope efficiency of the TiO2 SA was 11.72 %, which is higher than the slope efficiency of the BTiO2-x SA. The maximum average and peak power generated by the BTiO2-x SA were 55.67 % and 54.83 % higher than the TiO2 SA. As for mode-locked outputs, BTiO2-x SA can generate pulsed laser at a low threshold power of 62.29 mW compared to TiO2 SA. Furthermore, BTiO2-x SA produced a shorter pulse width of 5.04 ps, whereas TiO2 is 9.20 ps. This study demonstrates that BTiO2-x SA has the potential to produce ultrashort pulse width using the mode-locked technique.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Historically, much of machine learning research has focused on the performance of the algorithm alone, but recently more attention has been focused on optimizing joint human-algorithm performance. Here, we analyze a specific type of human-algorithm collaboration where the algorithm has access to a set of $n$ items, and presents a subset of size $k$ to the human, who selects a final item from among those $k$. This scenario could model content recommendation, route planning, or any type of labeling task. Because both the human and algorithm have imperfect, noisy information about the true ordering of items, the key question is: which value of $k$ maximizes the probability that the best item will be ultimately selected? For $k=1$, performance is optimized by the algorithm acting alone, and for $k=n$ it is optimized by the human acting alone. Surprisingly, we show that for multiple of noise models, it is optimal to set $k \\\\in [2, n-1]$ - that is, there are strict benefits to collaborating, even when the human and algorithm have equal accuracy separately. We demonstrate this theoretically for the Mallows model and experimentally for the Random Utilities models of noisy permutations. However, we show this pattern is reversed when the human is anchored on the algorithm's presented ordering - the joint system always has strictly worse performance. We extend these results to the case where the human and algorithm differ in their accuracy levels, showing that there always exist regimes where a more accurate agent would strictly benefit from collaborating with a less accurate one, but these regimes are asymmetric between the human and the algorithm's accuracy.\",\n",

Previously, we had to use a simple MMT watermarking methodology and estimated that using image quality parameters, primarily considering the diagonal component (HH). For embedding watermarks after the decomposition process carried through MMT, the presented distributed data embedding strategy, however, emphasises on middle frequency signal-groups. We have used hypothesized watermarking technique to process five benchmark images during the experiments to examine the scheme\\u2019s capability.

      "      \"abstract\": \"In biomaterials development, creating materials with desirable properties can be a time\\u2010consuming and resource\\u2010intensive process, often relying on serendipitous discoveries. A potential route to accelerate this process is to employ artificial intelligence methodologies such as machine learning (ML). Herein, the possibility to predict anti\\u2010inflammatory properties of the polymers by using a simplified model of inflammation and a restrained dataset is explored. Cellular assays with 50 different polymers are conducted using the murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 as a model. These experiments generate a dataset which is used to develop a ML model based on Bayesian logistic regression. After conducting a Bayesian logistic regression analysis, two ML models, K\\u2010nearest neighbors (KNN) and Na\\u00efve Bayes, are employed to predict anti\\u2010inflammatory polymers properties. The study finds that the probability of a polymer having anti\\u2010inflammatory properties is multiplied by three if it is a polycation, and that nitric oxide secretion is a good indicator in determining the anti\\u2010inflammatory properties of a polymer, which in this work are defined by tumor necrosis factor alpha expression decrease. Overall, the study suggests that with appropriate dataset design, ML techniques can provide valuable information on functional polymer properties, enabling faster and more efficient biomaterial development.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"A test known as an MRI creates precise images of the inside of the body using strong magnets, radio waves, and a computer. One of the most dynamic and secure imaging methods now used in clinics is MRI. However, MRI acquisitions can take a long time, which limits patient throughput, reduces the range of possible applications, and raises expenses. In this paper we proposed a compressed sensing (CS) technique for speeding up MRI acquisition time. The proposed methods involve the under-sampling k-space theorem to collect fewer data points. Deep learning techniques are then used with these data points to quickly produce an image of high quality. Several experiments are conducted to justify the use of deep learning methods for reconstructing MRI images using k-space data with under-sampling techniques. The experimental results exhibited good-quality images in a short time in terms of reconstruction with limited measurements.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Manual Coconut harvesting requires tree-climbing skill, it is hazardous because of the tree's hard shell, height and high occlusions on the tree. Further, it is difficult to determine whether a coconut is ripe or not because of the outside illumination and various background. The development of a coconut ripen stages detection system with the help of deep learning techniques is of great interest to farmers. This research work proposes a deep learning-based instance segmentation technique to identify different coconut ripeness stages. To improve instance segmentation accuracy to identify different coconut ripeness stages, the SOLOv2 model is used. In this research work, collected image dataset consisting of approximately 500 RGB images of different types of coconut fruits in coconut plantations during daylight under natural lighting conditions using a handheld digital single-lens reflex camera. The proposed SOLOv2 model was trained, validated, and tested on 500 manually acquired and augmented images. On the test dataset, the mean average precision (mAP) and Average Precision (at different intersections-over-union (IoU) thresholds), Average Precision (at different intersection-over-union (IoU) thresholds) attained by the model were 0.628, 0.628 and 0.811, respectively, with an average precision and recall for identifying ripeness stages as 0.912 and 0.883, respectively. I data enables the creation of a comprehensive vision system to pinpoint the cutting spot on the coconut cluster and select the harvesting method. The experimental results enable us to develop an automated ripeness detection system to determine the ripeness stages for harvesting and pinpointing the cutting spot on the coconut tree.\",\n",

The combined prediction model is constructed using quadratic nonlinear programming, while the dynamic weighted combined prediction model is constructed using the reciprocal of variance method. Empirical results show that the combined prediction models effectively mitigate the limitations of the four individual models and exhibit good predictive performance. Among them, the dynamic weighted combined prediction model, compared to the fixed weighted combined prediction model, is more suitable for time series data as the weights have time-varying characteristics.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"This paper presents a new method, called FlexiCurve, for photo retouching. Unlike most existing methods that perform image-to-image mapping, which requires expensive pixel-wise reconstruction, FlexiCurve takes an input image and estimates global curves to adjust the image. The adjustment curves are specially designed for performing piecewise mapping, taking nonlinear adjustment and differentiability into account. To cope with challenging and diverse properties in real-world photos, FlexiCurve is formulated to produce diverse estimations. The spatial dependencies among these estimations are implicitly modeled by a Transformer structure to improve local retouching of different regions. Thanks to the image-to-curve formulation, FlexiCurve only needs a lightweight network. Our method improves efficiency without compromising the retouching quality and losing details in the original image. The method is also appealing as it is not limited to paired training data, thus it can flexibly learn rich retouching styles from unpaired data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency, retouching performance, and flexibility of our method quantitatively and qualitatively.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"This study proposes a set of generic rules to revise existing neural networks for 3D point cloud processing to rotation-equivariant quaternion neural networks (REQNNs), in order to make feature representations of neural networks to be rotation-equivariant and permutation-invariant. Rotation equivariance of features means that the feature computed on a rotated input point cloud is the same as applying the same rotation transformation to the feature computed on the original input point cloud. We find that the rotation-equivariance of features is naturally satisfied, if a neural network uses quaternion features. Interestingly, we prove that such a network revision also makes gradients of features in the REQNN to be rotation-equivariant w.r.t. inputs, and the training of the REQNN to be rotation-invariant w.r.t. inputs. Besides, permutation-invariance examines whether the intermediate-layer features are invariant, when we reorder input points. We also evaluate the stability of knowledge representations of REQNNs, and the robustness of REQNNs to adversarial rotation attacks. Experiments have shown that REQNNs outperform traditional neural networks in both terms of classification accuracy and robustness on rotated testing samples.\",\n",

Thus, it is important to examine convoluted clinical information, reports, and photos quicker while maintaining a more significant precision level. In different cases., certain peculiarities are unpretentious to such an extent that individuals can't promptly distinguish them. At the point when a basic information examination on clinical information is expected to distinguish stowed-away connections or irregularities that are not obvious to people, AI innovations are being utilized in medical services for computational navigation. It is trying to execute algorithms to do such positions in any of them, yet it is considerably harder to develop calculation precision further while decreasing execution time. The meaning of preventive and productive medical services utilizing enormous information scattered through different loT gadgets is underlined in medical care and IT because of the late expanded interest. Medical care data investigation fundamentally includes forecast by utilizing a client's essential data and static information from a knowledge base. This research study proposes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and machine learning-based unique model for health care predictions.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Digital Twins (DTs) are gaining popularity because they provide precise digital copies of assets, processes, and systems. This is especially true when these DTs are paired with real-time simulation models that make use of modern technologies like machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data analytics. These combinations can provide a comprehensive and dynamic view of the monitored systems. Digital twin (DT) has shown tremendous potential to bring about revolutionary improvements in the field of construction site surveillance. There is, however, a notable paucity of empirical research identifying the constant elements affecting DT adoption in this industry. This research tries to fill that void by identifying the important elements that determine the usage of DT in construction. The study adopts a complete framework with the goal of increasing the use of DT in building site monitoring. The elements influencing the adoption and effectiveness of distributed ledger technology (DT) are divided into three categories: technological, organizational, and economic. Technological factors include the system's appropriateness and the robustness of the data infrastructure. Organizational considerations include the company's openness to innovation and leadership support. Economic aspects include things like return on investment (ROI) and cost-effectiveness. The research technique combines case studies and literature reviews to examine the benefits and drawbacks of DT in construction monitoring. This study's expected output is a comprehensive framework that aids construction businesses in optimizing the use of DT in site monitoring. This would allow for more efficient, data-driven, and forward-thinking processes. The study's ultimate purpose is to provide critical knowledge that will assist the building sector in adopting cutting-edge methods. The industry may better plan for the integration of this sophisticated technology into their operations by knowing the potential of DT and the variables driving its adoption. This, in turn, can lead to more efficiency, lower risks, and improved overall performance\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Modelling how concepts are related is a central topic in Lexical Semantics. A common strategy is to rely on knowledge graphs (KGs) such as ConceptNet, and to model the relation between two concepts as a set of paths. However, KGs are limited to a fixed set of relation types, and they are incomplete and often noisy. Another strategy is to distill relation embeddings from a fine-tuned language model. However, this is less suitable for words that are only indirectly related and it does not readily allow us to incorporate structured domain knowledge. In this paper, we aim to combine the best of both worlds. We model relations as paths but associate their edges with relation embeddings. The paths are obtained by first identifying suitable intermediate words and then selecting those words for which informative relation embeddings can be obtained. We empirically show that our proposed representations are useful for solving hard analogy questions.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The current state-of-the-art analysis of central nervous system (CNS) tumors through DNA methylation profiling relies on the tumor classifier developed by Capper and colleagues, which centrally harnesses DNA methylation data provided by users. Here, we present a distributed-computing-based approach for CNS tumor classification that achieves a comparable performance to centralized systems while safeguarding privacy. We utilize the t-distributed neighborhood embedding (t-SNE) model for dimensionality reduction and visualization of tumor classification results in two-dimensional graphs in a distributed approach across multiple sites (DistSNE). DistSNE provides an intuitive web interface (https://gin-tsne.med.uni-giessen.de) for user-friendly local data management and federated methylome-based tumor classification calculations for multiple collaborators in a DataSHIELD environment. The freely accessible web interface supports convenient data upload, result review, and summary report generation. Importantly, increasing sample size as achieved through distributed access to additional datasets allows DistSNE to improve cluster analysis and enhance predictive power. Collectively, DistSNE enables a simple and fast classification of CNS tumors using large-scale methylation data from distributed sources, while maintaining the privacy and allowing easy and flexible network expansion to other institutes. This approach holds great potential for advancing human brain tumor classification and fostering collaborative precision medicine in neuro-oncology.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Introduction: ChatGPT (OpenAI, San Francisco, California, United States) is a chatbot powered by language-based artificial intelligence (AI). It generates text based on the information provided by users. It is currently being evaluated in medical research, publishing, and healthcare. However, there has been no prior study on the evaluation of its ability to help in kidney transplant research. This feasibility study aimed to evaluate the application and accuracy of ChatGPT in the field of kidney transplantation. Methods: On two separate dates, February 21 and March 2, 2023, ChatGPT 3.5 was questioned regarding the medical treatment of kidney transplants and related scientific facts. The responses provided by the chatbot were compiled, and a panel of two specialists reviewed the correctness of each answer. Results: We demonstrated that ChatGPT possessed substantial general knowledge of kidney transplantation; however, they lacked sufficient information and had inaccurate information that necessitates a deeper understanding of the topic. Moreover, ChatGPT failed to provide references for any of the scientific data it provided regarding kidney transplants, and when requested for references, it provided inaccurate ones. Conclusion: The results of this short feasibility study indicate that ChatGPT may have the ability to assist in data collecting when a particular query is posed. However, caution should be exercised and it should not be used in isolation as a supplement to research or decisions regarding healthcare because there are still challenges with data accuracy and missing information.\",\n",

We establish an ecological poverty evaluation index system, predict the poverty reduction index using a neural network, analyze the developmental relationship between the ecological environment and socio-economy within Guangdong\\u2019s impoverished counties utilizing an improved decoupling index, and finally employ a heatmap to dissect the spatiotemporal distribution features of poverty alleviation pressure. The main findings are as follows: (1) Fewer poor counties in Guangdong Province decouple natural ecology and social economy between 2013 and 2021, but overall poverty pressure is declining; (2) The pressure to reduce poverty and its changes vary greatly across different regions, with the pressure being concentrated in the north and less in the center and east. The essay makes appropriate policy recommendations for reducing poverty in various Guangdong Province regions based on the aforementioned findings.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Visual simultaneous location and mapping (VSLAM) has been widely used today, but for some tough cases with insufficient feature points (such as weak texture and motion blur), it is still an ongoing challenge to further boost the corresponding robustness and accuracy. In this article, to address the problem of inadequate feature points, for conventional visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), we improve the original feature matching mechanism by providing more correspondences with higher position precision. Firstly, based on the original feature matching results in the map initialization stage, a single-point least square matching (LSM) which iteratively refines the position of the matching points by considering geometric and photometric consistency, is presented to improve the map initialization result. Secondly, to improve the tracking performance, given the motion model, the single-point LSM is again used to yield new correspondences from the unsuccessfully matched features of the original matching mechanism between the current frame and the previous frame in the tracking thread, and these extra correspondences participate in and boost the subsequent pose optimization. Lastly, for newly inserted keyframe, we focus on identifying the corresponding 3-D map points\\u2019 reprojections on relevant local neighbor keyframes, these reprojections are added in the local bundle adjustment (BA) optimization for further improving the estimation of camera pose and local map. The popular VSLAM package, oriented FAST and rotated BRIEF (ORB)-SLAM2, is used to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed improvements. An ablation study on accuracy and tracking stability on public datasets are reported, furthermore, the comparisons with several state of the arts (namely, visual-inertial state estimator (VINS)-Mono, ORB-SLAM3, direct sparse odometry (DSO), point-line (PL)-SLAM) are investigated. The experimental results show that our approach can improve accuracy in weak texture scenes and motion blur cases, reduce the number of tracking loss and improve tracking robustness.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"As deep neural networks constantly improve and provide state-of-the-art solutions to various problems, deployment of these models becomes more common, and so does the importance of protecting these models against malicious attacks attempting to replicate these models. In this paper, we present a novel zero-knowledge method for attacking and stealing knowledge from deep neural networks. Our method utilizes unlabeled data and the predictions of the mentor model we would like to steal. The presented method targets the most protected models which reveal only the minimal amount of information, i.e., the predicted label. We assume no access to any internal information about the model, and no access to the training data. The presented method improves the SOTA performance of attacking protected neural network models. The results show that all classification neural networks are vulnerable to the presented attack method, and any attacker can effectively replicate these models without having access to their architecture, parameters, training data, or softmax outputs.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"PseudoInverse learning (PIL) is proposed to increase the convergence speed of conventional gradient descent. PIL can be trained with fast and reliable convolutional neural networks (CNNs) without a gradient using a pseudoinverse matrix. However, PIL has several problems when training a network. First, there is an out-of-memory problem because all batches are required during one epoch of training. Second, the network cannot be deeper because more unreliable input pseudoinverse matrices are used as the deeper PIL layer is stacked. Therefore, PIL has not yet been effectively applied to widely used deep models. Inspired by the limitation of the existing PIL, we propose a novel error propagation methodology that allows the fine-tuning process, which is often used in a resource-constrained environment, to be performed more accurately. In detail, by using both PIL and gradient descent, we not only enable mini-batch training, which was impossible in PIL, but also achieve higher accuracy through more accurate error propagation. Moreover, unlike the existing PIL, which uses only the pseudoinverse matrix of the CNN input, we additionally use the pseudoinverse matrix of weights to compensate for the limitations of PIL; thus, the proposed method enables faster and more accurate error propagation in the CNN training process. As a result, it is efficient for fine-tuning in resource-constrained environments, such as mobile/edge devices that require an accuracy comparable to small training epochs. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves the accuracy after ResNet-101 fine-tuning on the CIFAR-100 dataset by 2.78% compared to the baseline.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"One of the most significant graph data analysis tasks is graph classification, as graphs are complex data structures used for illustrating relationships between entity pairs. Graphs are essential in many domains, such as the description of chemical molecules, biological networks, social relationships, etc. Real-world graphs are complicated and large. As a result, there is a need to find a way to represent or encode a graph\\u2019s structure so that it can be easily utilized by machine learning models. Therefore, graph embedding is considered one of the most powerful solutions for graph representation. Inspired by the Doc2Vec model in Natural Language Processing (NLP), this paper first investigates different ways of (sub)graph embedding to represent each graph or subgraph as a fixed-length feature vector, which is then used as input to any classifier. Thus, two supervised classifiers\\u2014a deep neural network (DNN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN)\\u2014are proposed to enhance graph classification. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets indicate that the proposed models obtain competitive results and are superior to some traditional classification methods and deep-learning-based approaches on three out of five benchmark datasets, with an impressive accuracy rate of 94% on the NCI1 dataset.\",\n",

In the current scenario, machine learning and/or deep learning are becoming very popular in medical science for disease prediction. Much research is underway in the form of disease prediction models by machine learning. To ensure the performance and accuracy of the machine learning model, it is important to keep some basic things in mind during training. The machine learning model has several issues which must be rectified duration of the training of the model so that the learning model works efficiently such as model selection, parameter tuning, dataset splitting, cross-validation, bias-variance tradeoff, overfitting, underfitting, and so on. Under- and over-fitting are the two main issues that affect machine learning models.

      "      \"abstract\": \"Future network architectures are expected to be autonomous, intelligent, and service-based, posing new security challenges. To address these challenges, the Artificial Intelligence (AI) security service emerges as a promising solution. However, the complex service configurations and performance guarantees hinder the autonomous deployment of the AI security service. This paper proposes an autonomous deployment mechanism in Software-Defined Networking/Network Function Virtualization (SDN/NFV) enabled networks. First, our mechanism introduces user and decision planes on top of the control plane, enabling hierarchical intent expression and translation from user security intent to security policies. Then, we analyze the embedding problem of the AI-based Security Function Chain (AISFC) during security policy generation. We formulate the AISFC embedding problem as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) task to minimize the total response delay. By decomposing it into AISF placement and routing, we design a heuristic algorithm with polynomial time complexity. Finally, we validate the proposed mechanism through a prototype system and numerical simulations, demonstrating its ability to autonomously translate, implement, and guarantee the user security intent. Comparative analysis shows that our approach considering the relationship between available computing resources and delay achieves smaller response delays than the baseline. Furthermore, our algorithm achieves a gap from optimality approximately 28.57% smaller than the greedy algorithm and supports networks that are 4.34 times larger in scale than the exact solution within a 2-second execution time.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Currently, Techniques for detecting objects using deep learning methods are widely used. However, the FPN-based multi-scale feature fusion technology may not fully capture the network's representational capacity. In addition, in the use of attention mechanism, there's a lack of an attention mechanism that can effectively capture long-distance dependency relationships in sequences and adjust the importance of different channels. To address these issues, a novel multi-scale attention algorithm is presented, which incorporates a combination of YOLOv5 and BiFPN structures to replace the original FPN structure. Comparative experiments on different classical algorithms were conducted on the PASCAL VOC2007 and VOC2012 datasets. According to the experimental results, the network equipped with the multi-scale attention mechanism achieves higher detection accuracy. It is important to note that proper nouns and grammar have been translated accurately.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"One of the main challenges in deploying a keystroke dynamics-based continuous authentication scheme on smartphones is ensuring low error rates over time. Unstable false rejection rates (FRRs) would lead to frequent phone locks during long-term use, and deteriorating attack detection rates would jeopardize its security benefits. The fact that it is undesirable to train complex deep learning models directly on smartphones or send private sensor data to servers for training present unique deployment constraints, requiring on-device solutions that can be trained fully on smartphones. To improve authentication accuracy while satisfying such real-world deployment constraints, we propose two novel feature engineering techniques: (1) computation of pair-wise correlations between accelerometer and gyroscope sensor values, and (2) on-device feature extraction technique to compute dynamic time warping (DTW) distance measurements between autoencoder inputs and outputs via transfer-learning. Using those two feature sets in an ensemble blender, we achieved 6.4 percent equal error rate (EER) in a public dataset. In comparison, blending two state-of-the-art solutions achieved 14.1 percent EER in the same test settings. Our real-world dataset evaluation showed increasing FRRs (user frustration) over two months; however, through periodic model retraining, we were able to maintain average FRRs around 2.5 percent while keeping attack detection rates around 89 percent. The proposed solution has been deployed in the latest Samsung Galaxy smartphone series to protect secure workspace through continuous authentication.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"In recent years, the emergence of deep learning and the need for big data analysis have created a demand for computers with high computational performance and energy efficiency. Since conventional ASICs and general-purpose CPUs cannot meet this requirement, domain-specific architectures that constrain applications are currently the focus of attention. Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Architecture (CGRA), one of the domain-specific architectures, is attracting attention because it is superior to CPUs and FPGAs in terms of computational performance and power efficiency [1]. As depicted in Fig. 1, CGRA comprises a two-dimensional array of Processing Elements (PEs) and provides flexibility to change the instructions executed on the PEs and the connections between them, depending on the software being executed. On the other hand, the mapping problem for CGRA is an NP-complete problem, and there exist tradeoffs between solution accuracy and execution time. For real time applications, it is indispensable to shorten the mapping time. Thus, in this study, we propose an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) based mapping method for Elastic CGRA that aims to shorten mapping time while preserving solution accuracy. We have also implemented and preliminary evaluated the proposed method.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The flourishing success of Deep Neural Networks(DNNs) on RGB-input perception tasks has opened unbounded possibilities for non-RGB-input perception tasks, such as object detection from wireless signals, lidar scans, and infrared images. Compared to the matured development pipeline of RGB-input (source modality) models, developing non-RGB-input (target-modality) models from scratch poses excessive challenges in the modality-specific network design/training tricks and labor in the target-modality annotation. In this paper, we propose ModAlity Calibration (MAC), an efficient pipeline for calibrating target-modality inputs to the DNN object detection models developed on the RGB (source) modality. We compose a target-modality-input model by adding a small calibrator module ahead of a source-modality model and introduce MAC training techniques to impose dense supervision on the calibrator. By leveraging (1) prior knowledge synthesized from the source-modality model and (2) paired {target, source} data with zero manual annotations, our target-modality models reach comparable or better metrics than baseline models that require 100% manual annotations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MAC by composing the WiFi-input, Lidar-input, and Thermal-Infrared-input models upon the pre-trained RGB-input models respectively.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"This paper extends the star set reachability approach to verify the robustness of feed-forward neural networks (FNNs) with sigmoidal activation functions such as Sigmoid and TanH. The main drawbacks of the star set approach in Sigmoid/TanH FNN verification are scalability, feasibility, and optimality issues in some cases due to the linear programming solver usage. We overcome this challenge by proposing a relaxed star (RStar) with symbolic intervals, which allows the usage of the back-substitution technique in DeepPoly to find bounds when overapproximating activation functions while maintaining the valuable features of a star set. RStar can overapproximate a sigmoidal activation function using four linear constraints (RStar4) or two linear constraints (RStar2), or only the output bounds (RStar0). We implement our RStar reachability algorithms in NNV and compare them to DeepPoly via robustness verification of image classification DNNs benchmarks. The experimental results show that the original star approach (i.e., no relaxation) is the least conservative of all methods yet the slowest. RStar4 is computationally much faster than the original star method and is the second least conservative approach. It certifies up to 40% more images against adversarial attacks than DeepPoly and on average 51 times faster than the star set. Last but not least, RStar0 is the most conservative method, which could only verify two cases for the CIFAR10 small Sigmoid network, \\u03b4 = 0.014. However, it is the fastest method that can verify neural networks up to 3528 times faster than the star set and up to 46 times faster than DeepPoly in our evaluation.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Over the past two decades, research has highlighted the profound influence emotions can have on students\\u2019 learning, achievement, and wellbeing. Being able to successfully regulate one\\u2019s emotions is now viewed as crucial when learning in educational settings. To support students with this process, a growing line of research has explored various ways of helping students understand and manage their emotions (e.g., via the use of digital tools aimed at helping students become more aware of their emotions and prompting ways to regulate these emotions). Despite this, limited research has been undertaken in online group learning settings, where students work remotely together as part of their course using collaborative communication tools. These learning contexts present unique challenges which can make emotion regulation more difficult than in face-to-face learning environments (e.g., delayed response times when communicating with peers and teachers and a reduced sense of how others are feeling, due to limited emotional cues when learning online). In this paper, we describe an approach used at the UK Open University (UKOU) to assist students\\u2019 emotion awareness and regulation during a 9-week group project. This involves the use of short questionnaires which have been embedded into the Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) of a module. Since their inclusion, these questionnaires have been found to enhance emotional awareness in many students, as well as support the regulation of emotions in the group project. To conclude this paper, reflections on using the short questionnaires are discussed and implications for educators and institutions are identified.\",\n",

In contrast to conventional graph-based methods, our proposed multiscale-voxel-graph region-of-interest (RoI) pooling module constructs graphs across diverse voxel resolutions to obtain geometric structure information on voxel features. Initially, our multiscale-voxel-graph RoI pooling module sample voxel center points with voxel-wise feature vectors and 3D region proposals from backbone network. Subsequently, graphs are constructed at different scales and graph features are aggregated for second-stage refinement. The experimental results demonstrate the potential of using multiscale graphs across different voxel resolutions for 3D object detection, achieving decent experimental results with state-of-the-art methods.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Accurate hand gesture prediction is crucial for effective upper-limb prosthetic limbs control. As the high flexibility and multiple degrees of freedom exhibited by human hands, there has been a growing interest in integrating deep networks with high-density surface electromyography (HD-sEMG) grids to enhance gesture recognition capabilities. However, many existing methods fall short in fully exploit the specific spatial topology and temporal dependencies present in HD-sEMG data. Additionally, these studies are often limited number of gestures and lack generality. Hence, this study introduces a novel gesture recognition method, named STGCN-GR, which leverages spatio-temporal graph convolution networks for HD-sEMG-based human-machine interfaces. Firstly, we construct muscle networks based on functional connectivity between channels, creating a graph representation of HD-sEMG recordings. Subsequently, a temporal convolution module is applied to capture the temporal dependences in the HD-sEMG series and a spatial graph convolution module is employed to effectively learn the intrinsic spatial topology information among distinct HD-sEMG channels. We evaluate our proposed model on a public HD-sEMG dataset comprising a substantial number of gestures (i.e., 65). Our results demonstrate the remarkable capability of the STGCN-GR method, achieving an impressive accuracy of 91.07% in predicting gestures, which surpasses state-of-the-art deep learning methods applied to the same dataset.\",\n",

However, in the related field of metagenomics binning contigs are routinely clustered using information from both the contig sequences and their abundance. We introduce Taxometer, a neural network based method that improves the annotations and estimates the quality of any taxonomic classifier by combining contig abundance profiles and tetra-nucleotide frequencies. When applied to five short-read CAMI2 datasets, it increased the average share of correct species-level contig annotations of the MMSeqs2 tool from 66.6% to 86.2% and reduced the share of wrong species-level annotations in the CAMI2 Rhizosphere dataset two-fold on average for Metabuli, Centrifuge, and Kraken2. Finally, we applied Taxometer to two complex long-read metagenomics data sets for benchmarking taxonomic classifiers. Taxometer is available as open-source software and can enhance any taxonomic annotation of metagenomic contigs.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Visual question answering is a multimodal task that requires the joint comprehension of visual and textual information. However, integrating visual and textual semantics solely through attention layers is insufficient to comprehensively understand and align information from both modalities. Intuitively, object attributes can naturally serve as a bridge to unify them, which has been overlooked in previous research. In this paper, we propose a novel VQA approach from the perspective of utilizing object attribute, aiming to achieve better object-level visual-language alignment and multimodal scene understanding. Specifically, we design an attribute fusion module and a contrastive knowledge distillation module. The attribute fusion module constructs a multimodal graph neural network to fuse attributes and visual features through message passing. The enhanced object-level visual features contribute to solving fine-grained problem like counting-question. The better object-level visual-language alignment aids in understanding multimodal scenes, thereby improving the model's robustness. Furthermore, to augment scene understanding and the out-of-distribution performance, the contrastive knowledge distillation module introduces a series of implicit knowledge. We distill knowledge into attributes through contrastive loss, which further strengthens the representation learning of attribute features and facilitates visual-linguistic alignment. Intensive experiments on six datasets, COCO-QA, VQAv2, VQA-CPv2, VQA-CPv1, VQAvs and TDIUC, show the superiority of the proposed method.\",\n",

However, no research has integrated the four RNA methylation regulators of m6A, m1A, m5C and m7G in gliomas to analyze their relationship with glioma prognosis and intratumoral heterogeneity.Based on three in\\u2010house single\\u2010cell RNA\\u2010sequencing (scRNA\\u2010seq) data, the glioma heterogeneity and characteristics of m6A/m1A/m5C/m7G\\u2010related regulators were elucidated. Based on publicly available bulk RNA\\u2010sequencing (RNA\\u2010seq) data, a risk\\u2010score system for predicting the overall survival (OS) for gliomas was established by three machine learning methods and multivariate Cox regression analysis, and validated in an independent cohort.Seven cell types were identified in gliomas by three scRNA\\u2010seq data, and 22 m6A/m1A/m5C/m7G\\u2010related regulators among the marker genes of different cell subtypes were discovered. Three m6A/m1A/m5C/m7G\\u2010related regulators were selected to construct prognostic risk\\u2010score model, including EIFA, NSUN6 and TET1. The high\\u2010risk patients showed higher immune checkpoint expression, higher tumor microenvironment scores, as well as higher tumor mutation burden and poorer prognosis compared with low\\u2010risk patients. Additionally, the area under the curve values of the risk score and nomogram were 0.833 and 0.922 for 3 year survival and 0.759 and 0.885 for 5 year survival for gliomas. EIF3A was significantly highly expressed in glioma tissues in our in\\u2010house RNA\\u2010sequencing data (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05).These findings may contribute to further understanding of the role of m6A/m1A/m5C/m7G\\u2010related regulators in gliomas, and provide novel and reliable biomarkers for gliomas prognosis and treatment.\",\n",

However, this scheme depicts how convolutional neural networks using VGG19 model can provide an effective mechanism to detect brain tumors at an early stage using MRI images and can save the lives of mankind. Consequently, this research classified glioma brain tumor images using VGG-19 with HE preprocessing data. The model was tested to get a comparison of accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score of the two test data, namely the original data and HE data. Based on the results of model testing, we can see in table2\\u00a0 that the original data produced the highest values of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with values of 97% accuracy, 100% precision, 97% recall, and 98% f1 score.

      "      \"abstract\": \"Interferometry is used to obtain information about the Earth's surface elevation. Surface height can be derived from inter-ferometric phase images, although the inherent phase noise reduces the accuracy and reliability of this information. Phase noise poses a challenge in obtaining precise information, es-pecially in steep areas. Therefore, it is essential to reduce the noise before extracting the surface information embed-ded in the interferometric phase. Widely used phase filtering methods can be grouped into three categories: spatial domain methods, transform domain methods, and nonlocal methods (NL). The Refined Lee Filter is a spatial domain method that reduces noise through local statistics. Instead of adopting the conventional approach of using a moving square window, the Refined Lee Filter employs sixteen fringe-aligned windows and develops an algorithm to select the window containing pixels with the most homogeneous phases. This study presents a proposal for filtering interferometric phase based on a numerical expression for multilook phase difference, which is more manageable compared to the expression used in the Refined Lee Filter. The proposed filter aims to improve the execution time in the phase noise filtering process. To achieve this goal, we introduce a constraint on the number of looks into the phase difference expression defined by Gierull [4], with the hope of making the filtering process faster. Nu-merical experiments on simulated and real data were used to validate the proposed approach.\",\n",

Agricultural producers suffer losses every year due to the difficulties arising from seasonal conditions. In this study, a deep learning network has been developed to detect bloomed/non-bloomed trees that will support the use of pesticides in order to protect farmers from the damage of frost. For this purpose, a new data set including bloomed/non-bloomed was created over two years. Bloomed or non-bloomed tree detection performances were evaluated using different convolutional neural network (CNN) models with transfer learning on this new data set. Accuracy comparisons are given by including deep learning structures as NASNetMobile, MobileNetV2, ResNet50V2, VGG-16, VGG-19, and InceptionV3, and CNN from Scratch in the evaluation. The results are presented by changing different epochs and optimizer hyperparameter values with different learning rates. In addition, the runtime and parameter values of the examined CNN models were also compared. For the CNN from Scratch model, six different models were obtained by changing the number of convolution blocks and epochs. It was observed that the ResNet50V2 model made the best prediction with 98.65% accuracy after RMSprop optimizer, 10\\u22124 learning rate and 20 epochs of training.\",\n",

This survey research investigates an integrated method for identifying ASD using behavioural characteristic questionnaires and epilepsy using EEG corpus inside a single system. We provide an overview of all the relevant research, emphasizing the difficulties in diagnosing each of these disorders separately and in combination. Our suggested approach combines behavioural questionnaire assessments for ASD with EEG-based analysis for epilepsy detection in an effort to improve diagnostic accuracy and expedite the evaluation process. This study examines the approaches, difficulties, and developments in both domains, providing perspectives on possible overlaps and prospects for further investigation. So, an attempt has been made to review on the pattern detection methods for epilepsy seizure detection from EEG signals. More than 150 research papers have been discussed to determine the techniques for detecting epileptic seizures. Further, the literature review confirms that the pattern recognition techniques required to detect epileptic seizures varies across the electroencephalogram (EEG) datasets of different conditions. This is mostly owing to the fact that EEG detected under different conditions have different characteristics.\",\n",

However, most methods are developed based on data from a single modality, and ignore the relationships among subjects. In machine learning problems, hypergraph can be used to express the relationships between objects. In light of this, a framework for early diagnosis of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease based on multimodal hypergraph attention network is proposed in this paper. Specifically, we combine multimodal features to construct cross modal hypergraph, which represents the high-order structural relationships among subjects. Finally, a hypergraph attention network is used to fuse hypergraphs and perform the final classification. Our experimental results on the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database show that our proposed method has better classification performance than the most advanced methods.\",\n",

Therefore, there is a growing need for the development and application of Fruit Image Classification systems within the community, particularly in the field of agriculture. Such applications can play a pivotal role in leveraging technology to benefit the agricultural sector, empowering users to gain satisfaction and knowledge regarding different fruits through the utilization of these applications. In this study, we employ both a conventional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture and a Residual Network-50 for fruit image classification. To ensure robust performance evaluation, the dataset is divided into training and testing subsets, with fruits categorized into specific classes. Furthermore, identical preprocessing and optimization techniques are applied to both architectures to maintain consistency and fairness during the evaluation process. The results of our classification experiments on a dataset consisting of 17 different fruit classes reveal that the conventional CNN architecture achieves an impressive accuracy of 0.998 (99%) with a minimal loss of 0.009. On the other hand, the Residual Network-50 demonstrates a slightly lower accuracy of 0.994 (99%) but with a slightly higher loss of 0.02. Despite the higher loss, the Residual Network-50's accuracy remains comparable to that of the conventional architecture, showcasing its potential for fruit image classification. By leveraging the power of machine learning and these advanced architectures, fruit image classification systems can provide valuable insights and assistance to users. They can facilitate informed decision-making in various domains, including agriculture, food production, and consumer education.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Action recognition in still images is a challenging task compared to video action recognition due to the limited information provided by a single image. Typically, many approaches for action recognition in still images involve two parts: feature extraction and classification. This paper follows the basic paradigm and proposes a Text-Image Alignment(TIA) method that utilizes a text-image alignment classifier based on ground truth labels to assist recognition. Besides, TIA adopts various prompt templates to improve the generalization ability of the TIA classifier. Additionally, this paper proposes Knowledge Distilllation(KD) training strategy by introducing a pre-trained image classifier that serves as a teacher classifier to improve the performance of TIA classifier. And the way to optimize the performance is to minimize the distance between two classifiers. As a result, a novel method is proposed in this paper. To validate the generalization and effectiveness of TIA-KD, experiments are conducted on two different basic archi-tectures: Transformer and CNN on Stanford40, PascalVOC, and HICO, respectively. The experiment results show that the proposed method outperforms baselines by 1~4.5% on above three datasets, respectively.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Lung cancer is the leading cause of death in the USA It is caused for various reasons, such as malignant tumors that grow spontaneously in the lung and spread to other parts of the body, where they can be devastating. Other than that, there are so many external reasons why smoking is the primary factor that gradually creates lung problems that lead to lung cancer. However, we can prevent this deadly cancer by detecting it at an early stage. A machine learning-based detection model has the potential to detect lung cancer, which helps to predict the early stage of cancer. So, we aim to build some powerful machine learning algorithms to predict this cancer that can help physicians make decisions about the diagnosis process of a particular patient, whether the patient needs a high or a regular diagnosis level. This can reduce the treatment cost of a patient because the physician knows from the result how many doses are needed for a patient, so it can avoid unnecessary treatment, which saves money and brings an efficient diagnosis system. We aimed to build a sustainable model that could predict the disease accurately, and finally, our models, such as XGBoost, achieved the highest value of other models. According to the accuracy level, XGBoost performed up to 95.92%, LightGBM, AdaBoost, Logistic Regression, and Support vector machine achieved 91.50%, 93.32%, 57.41 %, and 89.32% accuracy, respectively.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"\\n In the past decade, human digital twins (HDTs) attracted much attention in and beyond digital twin (DT) applications. In this paper, we discuss the concept and the development of HDTs with a focus on their architecture, ethical concerns, key enabling technologies, and the opportunities of using HDTs in design. Based on the literature, we identified that data, model, and interface are three key modules in the proposed HDT architecture. Ethics is an important concern in the development and the use of the HDT from the humanities perspective. For key enabling technologies that support the functions of the HDT, we argue that the IoT infrastructure, data security, wearables, human modeling, explainable artificial intelligence, minimum viable sensing, and data visualization are strongly associated with the development of HDTs. Based on current applications, we highlight the design opportunities of using HDTs in designing products, services, and systems, as well as a design tool to facilitate the design process.\",\n",

An innovative algorithm combining multi-criterion decision-making (DM) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Machine learning (ML), called DMPSO-ML, was used for expediting convergence toward the optimum solution. The main objective function in the study included minimizing the cost or mass of the four-story RC frame subjected to blast loadings while simultaneously satisfying all requirements established by building design principles. A blast load emanating from an internal explosion experiment was considered. The modular sizes of members, standard steel bar diameters, steel bar spacing rules, architectural provisions and additional constructability requirements were obtained directly from the output of DMPSO-ML yielding automatic final designs. The results from this study established the validity of the presented DMPSO-ML algorithm for obtaining optimum results in structural optimization problems involving blast effects.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Emerging memory technologies, such as Gain Cell-embedded Dynamic Random Access Memory (GC-eDRAM), play an essential part in the process of improving the overall performance of current multi-processor systems. GC-eDRAM, on the other hand, has its own set of distinct issues, particularly with regard to refresh operations. The number of cores and threads in contemporary processors continues to expand, which in turn leads to an increase in the number of concurrent refresh requests. This might cause contention, which in turn can lead to a possible performance decrease. In this article, we present an efficient arbitration method that was developed in order to precisely address the issues that are associated with numerous requests for a refresh in GC-eDRAM. This method takes use of the inherent parallelism of GC-eDRAM modules to make it possible to execute simultaneous refresh operations. As a result, contention is effectively reduced, and the overall performance of the system is improved. We provide a new arbitration method that prioritizes the pending refresh requests according to their level of urgency and optimizes the allocation of GC-eDRAM resources in order to guarantee that refresh operations are carried out in an effective manner. Our method modifies the arbitration priority in a dynamic manner according to the characteristics of the active workload. These characteristics include the request arrival rate, memory access patterns, and data location, among other considerations.\",\n",

This study aimed to analyze differentially expressed genes for both pregnancy complications and develop a Machine learning model for the early prognosis of recurrent implantation failure and pre-eclampsia. Differentially expressed genes for recurrent implantation failure consisted of 2486 downregulated genes and 809 upregulated genes, and pre-eclampsia, consisted of 13 downregulated genes and 10 upregulated genes followed by gene set enrichment analysis. Gene expression prolife of recurrent implantation failure and pre-eclampsia were used to develop the machine learning model. Random Forest performed best for recurrent implantation failure with a model accuracy of 96.47%, while the generalized linear model performed best for pre-eclampsia with a model accuracy of 80%.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models have exhibited exciting progress in their capabilities, capturing the interest of practitioners and the public alike. Yet, while the literature on the trustworthiness of GPT models remains limited, practitioners have proposed employing capable GPT models for sensitive applications such as healthcare and finance -- where mistakes can be costly. To this end, this work proposes a comprehensive trustworthiness evaluation for large language models with a focus on GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, considering diverse perspectives -- including toxicity, stereotype bias, adversarial robustness, out-of-distribution robustness, robustness on adversarial demonstrations, privacy, machine ethics, and fairness. Based on our evaluations, we discover previously unpublished vulnerabilities to trustworthiness threats. For instance, we find that GPT models can be easily misled to generate toxic and biased outputs and leak private information in both training data and conversation history. We also find that although GPT-4 is usually more trustworthy than GPT-3.5 on standard benchmarks, GPT-4 is more vulnerable given jailbreaking system or user prompts, potentially because GPT-4 follows (misleading) instructions more precisely. Our work illustrates a comprehensive trustworthiness evaluation of GPT models and sheds light on the trustworthiness gaps. Our benchmark is publicly available at https://decodingtrust.github.io/; our dataset can be previewed at https://huggingface.co/datasets/AI-Secure/DecodingTrust; a concise version of this work is at https://openreview.net/pdf?id=kaHpo8OZw2.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Natural Language Understanding (NLU) has recently made considerable progress, but there is still an immediate need to improve its performance. To this end, researchers have addressed the issue by introducing contextual embedding\\u2019s, which enable the NLU model to map words to their contextual meanings rather than just looking at their individual meanings. Contextual embedding\\u2019s enable the model to capture the nuances of words in the various contexts they are used in, allowing for better understanding and performance. Two methods\\u2014 feature engineering and transfer learning\\u2014have been employed to further improve performance. With feature engineering, transformed features are used to obtain improved accuracy and faster training times whereas transfer learning uses pre-trained models to reduce the computational power required for training. This approach has resulted in improved accuracy in the various language understanding tasks. Furthermore, the innovative use of contextual embedding\\u2019s in combination with various optimization methods has resulted in a much more reliable and accurate NLU model.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"In perfusion MRI, image voxels form a spatially organized network of systems, all exchanging indicator with their immediate neighbors. Yet the current paradigm for perfusion MRI analysis treats all voxels or regions\\u2010of\\u2010interest as isolated systems supplied by a single global source. This simplification not only leads to long\\u2010recognized systematic errors but also fails to leverage the embedded spatial structure within the data. Since the early 2000s, a variety of models and implementations have been proposed to analyze systems with between\\u2010voxel interactions. In general, this leads to large and connected numerical inverse problems that are intractible with conventional computational methods. With recent advances in machine learning, however, these approaches are becoming practically feasible, opening up the way for a paradigm shift in the approach to perfusion MRI. This paper seeks to review the work in spatiotemporal modelling of perfusion MRI using a coherent, harmonized nomenclature and notation, with clear physical definitions and assumptions. The aim is to introduce clarity in the state\\u2010of\\u2010the\\u2010art of this promising new approach to perfusion MRI, and help to identify gaps of knowledge and priorities for future research.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The research presented in the paper addresses challenges related to the development of more flexible systems for speech communication between humans and machines. Specifically, the paper presents the main results of the speech technology research group at the Faculty of Technical Sciences, University of Novi Sad, Serbia, in the development of a multilingual human-machine communication system. The approach, which fully exploits recent advances in the area of machine learning and artificial intelligence, extends the basic functionality of a text-to-speech system by increasing its flexibility with respect to the speaking style, speaker identity and even language, by means of neural network embedding. At the same time, the performance of automatic speech recognition is improved in terms of its adaptability to different channels and speakers based on machine learning algorithms originally used in image processing. Domain transfer, as well as creation of dynamic dictionaries have played a crucial role in most recent developments in the area of speech recognition. The focus of the research presented in the paper is on the cases when the available quantity of adaptation data is very small, which corresponds to an increased practical usability of proposed approaches in many real world scenarios.\",\n",

It has been widely used in the power system and gradually replaces the manual inspection of transformer core and clamp grounding current. However, after the installation and operation of such online monitoring devices in the converter station, it was found that there were problems such as unreasonable design and incomplete performance testing plans. This article, by measuring and analyzing the grounding current waveform of the converter transformer core and clamp, identifies the reasons for the abnormal measurement results of the grounding current online monitoring devices for the iron core and clamp during the installation and operation of the converter, and proposes corresponding measures, A higher precision harmonic detection technology and laboratory performance detection method have been proposed at the same time.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a formidable public health challenge across the globe and is the most prevalent cause of mortality. Early detection and accurate prediction of CVD can help prevent disease progression and reduce the risk of complications. Machine learning (ML) techniques show promising results in improving the accuracy and efficiency of CVD prediction to precision. However, the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms in CVD prediction largely depends on the selection of relevant features from complex datasets. The performance and interpretability of ML models are improved by feature selection strategies, which attempt to identify significant attributes while eliminating duplicate or irrelevant features. The feature selection and ML algorithms for CVD are thoroughly reviewed in this publication. The review provides insight into the selection of appropriate feature selection techniques and machine learning algorithms for accurate CVD prediction and evaluates the effectiveness and performance of these methods on cardiovascular datasets. Insights from the findings of this study can be used for interpreting the selection of optimal feature selection methods and ML algorithms for the precise prediction of cardiovascular disease, thereby improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs.\",\n",

To accomplish this, we create, implement, and assess a method in which cells are first categorized by their point of interest and then clustered based on their temporal distribution in each region. The proposed model has been tested using real world 5G mobile traffic datasets collected over 31 weeks in various cities. Our proposed model is capable of predicting mobile traffic patterns up to 2 weeks in advance and outperforms the naive baseline method by 2.5% overall.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"As one of the important components of Earth observation technology, land use and land cover (LULC) image classification plays an essential role. It uses remote sensing techniques to classify specific categories of ground cover as a means of analyzing and understanding the natural attributes of the Earth\\u2019s surface and the state of land use. It provides important information for applications in environmental protection, urban planning, and land resource management. However, remote sensing images are usually high-dimensional data and have limited available labeled samples, so performing the LULC classification task faces great challenges. In recent years, due to the emergence of deep learning technology, remote sensing data processing methods based on deep learning have achieved remarkable results, bringing new possibilities for the research and development of LULC classification. In this paper, we present a systematic review of deep-learning-based LULC classification, mainly covering the following five aspects: (1) introduction of the main components of five typical deep learning networks, how they work, and their unique benefits; (2) summary of two baseline datasets for LULC classification (pixel-level, patch-level) and performance metrics for evaluating different models (OA, AA, F1, and MIOU); (3) review of deep learning strategies in LULC classification studies, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), autoencoders (AEs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs); (4) challenges faced by LULC classification and processing schemes under limited training samples; (5) outlooks on the future development of deep-learning-based LULC classification.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Main memory is one of the most complex resources to analyze in multicore-based embedded real-time systems, with contention in the memory controller and the timing constraints of the main memory device as the main contributors to that complexity. One of the main challenges in multicore real-time systems is producing the required evidence on the management of contention delay for the certification. This stems from the fact that current MPSoCs barely provide any event monitors on how tasks interact and delay each other in memory. Besides, even if hardware and software mechanisms are in place to mitigate contention in the memory system, it is hard - if at all possible - to provide evidence about their correctness. In this work, we cover this gap by proposing a lightweight hardware mechanism that tightly tracks inter-core contention in memory. The proposed hardware mechanism, which we evaluate in detail, improves the quality of timing-related evidence that must be provided on how contention in main memory of multicore real-time systems is handled in adherence to applicable safety standards.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Origin-destination (OD) short-term passenger flow forecasting (OD STPFF) in urban rail transit (URT) is essential for developing timely network measures. The capacity utilization ratios of critical sections are key factors in developing these measures. The OD pairs passing through critical sections require a higher prediction accuracy than others; however, most studies have raised equal concerns on the prediction accuracy of each OD pair, namely, prediction at the network level. To address this problem, we raise heterogeneous time-variant concerns on OD pairs and employ an operation-oriented deep-learning architecture called the spatiotemporal convolutional neural network (STCNN) for realizing short-term OD passenger flow prediction. The architecture contains OD pair importance calculation, lagged spatiotemporal relationship construction, lagged spatiotemporal learning, real-time information learning, and sequential-temporal learning blocks. To this end, critical OD pairs are ascertained first, and the topological lagged spatiotemporal relationship among critical OD pairs are constructed and then normalized into grid-shaped data. The third block utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn the grid-shaped lagged spatiotemporal feature and real-time information in parallel. A temporal convolutional neural network (TCN) is utilized for learning the sequential-temporal feature at last. Further, we design a time-varying weighted masked loss function to jointly reinforce the concerns on critical OD pairs during model training. Finally, we test the proposed STCNN and its components on a field dataset from Chengdu Metro. Although the proposed STCNN performs only slightly better at the network level than the other models, it outperforms state-of-the-art methods with significant superiority on critical OD pairs.\",\n",

This progress necessitates the development of efficient and scalable spatial dimension reduction methods that can handle large-scale SRT data from multiple sections. Here, we developed FAST as a fast and efficient generalized probabilistic factor analysis for spatially aware dimension reduction, which simultaneously accounts for the count nature of SRT data and extracts a low-dimensional representation of SRT data across multiple sections, while preserving biological effects with consideration of spatial smoothness among nearby locations. Compared with existing methods, FAST uniquely models the count data across multiple sections while using a local spatial dependence with scalable computational complexity. Using both simulated and real datasets, we demonstrated the improved correlation between FAST estimated embeddings and annotated cell/domain types. Furthermore, FAST exhibits remarkable speed, with only FAST being applicable to analyze a mouse embryo Stereo-seq dataset with >2.3 million locations in only 2 hours. More importantly, FAST identified the differential activities of immune-related transcription factors between tumor and non-tumor clusters and also predicted a carcinogenesis factor CCNH as the upstream regulator of differentially expressed genes in a breast cancer Xenium dataset.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Vehicle detection systems play a crucial role in preventing accidents by providing real-time information about the location and movement of vehicles on the road. Monitoring speed is also essential for safety purposes as it enables the identification of vehicles that are exceeding speed limits or driving recklessly under current road conditions. The emergence of self-driving cars, which use a combination of artificial intelligence, algorithms, and sensors to navigate roads and make decisions without human intervention, is a rapidly advancing technology. Despite its complexity, this technology offers numerous advantages such as increased safety and reduced traffic congestion. One of the most significant benefits of self-driving cars is the potential to reduce accidents caused by human error, which is the leading cause of traffic accidents. By eliminating the need for human drivers, the risk of accidents can be significantly reduced. The frequency of car accidents is alarming, with one occurring every minute according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Auto insurance industry statistics indicate that every driver is likely to encounter at least four car accidents in their lifetime. Inexperienced drivers, particularly those aged 16 to 20, are at a higher risk of being involved in accidents. Annually, approximately 37,000 people die in car accidents, with one fatal accident occurring every 16 minutes. Among these, nearly 8,000 deaths involve drivers aged between 16 and 20 years old. Shockingly, more than 1,600 children under the age of 15 lose their lives in car accidents each year. To combat this alarming trend, measures are being taken to promote safe driving and reduce the frequency of accidents. Additionally, self-driving cars have the potential to improve traffic flow and minimize travel time as the vehicles can communicate with each other to optimize traffic flow and avoid congestion.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Salmonella enterica is a taxonomically diverse pathogen with over 2600 serovars associated with a wide variety of animal hosts including humans, other mammals, birds and reptiles. Some serovars are host-specific or host-restricted and cause disease in distinct host species, while others, such as serovar S. Typhimurium (STm), are generalists and have the potential to colonize a wide variety of species. However, even within generalist serovars such as STm it is becoming clear that pathovariants exist that differ in tropism and virulence. Identifying the genetic factors underlying host specificity is complex, but the availability of thousands of genome sequences and advances in machine learning have made it possible to build specific host prediction models to aid outbreak control and predict the human pathogenic potential of isolates from animals and other reservoirs. We have advanced this area by building host-association prediction models trained on a wide range of genomic features and compared them with predictions based on nearest-neighbour phylogeny. SNPs, protein variants (PVs), antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiles and intergenic regions (IGRs) were extracted from 3883 high-quality STm assemblies collected from humans, swine, bovine and poultry in the USA, and used to construct Random Forest (RF) machine learning models. An additional 244 recent STm assemblies from farm animals were used as a test set for further validation. The models based on PVs and IGRs had the best performance in terms of predicting the host of origin of isolates and outperformed nearest-neighbour phylogenetic host prediction as well as models based on SNPs or AMR data. However, the models did not yield reliable predictions when tested with isolates that were phylogenetically distinct from the training set. The IGR and PV models were often able to differentiate human isolates in clusters where the majority of isolates were from a single animal source. Notably, IGRs were the feature with the best performance across multiple models which may be due to IGRs acting as both a representation of their flanking genes, equivalent to PVs, while also capturing genomic regulatory variation, such as altered promoter regions. The IGR and PV models predict that ~45\\u200a% of the human infections with STm in the USA originate from bovine, ~40\\u200a% from poultry and ~14.5\\u200a% from swine, although sequences of isolates from other sources were not used for training. In summary, the research demonstrates a significant gain in accuracy for models with IGRs and PVs as features compared to SNP-based and core genome phylogeny predictions when applied within the existing population structure.

      "      \"abstract\": \"To address the challenge of predicting distributed photovoltaic (PV) power output for improved system integration and stability, this study proposes a novel method. Given the expanding scale of distributed PV systems and their economic constraints, accurate power output prediction becomes pivotal. Conventional prediction methods are hindered by the lack of meteorological stations at most distributed PV stations. In response, we present a dynamic convolutional generative adversarial network (DC-GAN) approach coupled with satellite cloud map video frames. By extracting shading features from satellite cloud images and utilizing DC-GAN, our method forecasts short-term cloud shading effects on future radiation. We further integrate radiation data from centralized PV stations, spatial correlations of distributed PV stations, and cloud shading characteristics. This information is used to construct a predictive model combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long short-term memory (LSTM), enhancing prediction accuracy. Comparative experiments confirm the superiority of our proposed method over traditional approaches, substantiating its effectiveness and practicality. Our method achieves notable accuracy improvements, establishing its value in predicting distributed PV power output. This research\\u2019s findings offer a valuable contribution to the field of renewable energy integration. In numerical assessments, our method demonstrates a significant increase in prediction accuracy, outperforming conventional techniques by 3.3%. This underscores the practical relevance and efficiency of our proposed approach in enhancing distributed PV power output prediction.\",\n",

Many of these images refer to materials held and exhibited by the Museum of Anthropology and Ethnology of the University of Florence. Here we conducted some trials on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) not only to colorize them, but also to retrieve information from the images useful for restoration and conservation. Modigliani's photographs are of particular interest. They illustrate and integrate his reflections on the use of photography for anthropological field research, offer valuable information on shooting techniques and on the original condition and colors of the artifacts. Although AI may not always reconstruct with absolute fidelity the original colors, especially for clothing, our results provides important guidelines for analysis and allows a cogent discussion of the possibilities of AI technology in anthropological research.\",\n",

Among these, carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) stand out due to their pivotal roles in various biological processes related to host health and nutrition. Here, we present CAZyLingua, the first tool that harnesses protein language model embeddings to build a deep learning framework that facilitates the annotation of CAZymes in metagenomic datasets. Our benchmarking results showed on average a higher F1 score (reflecting an average of precision and recall) on the annotated genomes of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Eggerthella lenta and Ruminococcus gnavus compared to the traditional sequence homology-based method in dbCAN2. We applied our tool to a paired mother/infant longitudinal dataset and revealed unannotated CAZymes linked to microbial development during infancy. When applied to metagenomic datasets derived from patients affected by fibrosis-prone diseases such as Crohn\\u2019s disease and IgG4-related disease, CAZyLingua uncovered CAZymes associated with disease and healthy states. In each of these metagenomic catalogs, CAZyLingua discovered new annotations that were previously overlooked by traditional sequence homology tools. Overall, the deep learning model CAZyLingua can be applied in combination with existing tools to unravel intricate CAZyme evolutionary profiles and patterns, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of microbial metabolic dynamics.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Suspended waterproof curtains combined with pumping wells are the primary method for controlling groundwater levels in foundation pits within soft soil areas. However, there is still a lack of a systematic approach to predict the groundwater drawdown within the foundation pit caused by the influence of these suspended curtains. In order to investigate the variation of groundwater level within the excavation during dewatering processes, the finite difference method is employed to analyze the seepage characteristics of foundation pits with suspended waterproof curtains. Basing on the concept of equivalent well, this study examines the coupled effects of aquifer anisotropy (ki), aquifer thickness (Mi), well screen length (li), and the depth of waterproof curtain embedment on the seepage field distortion. A characteristic curve is established for standard conditions, which exposes the blocking effect of the curtain on the amount of groundwater drawdown in the pit. Additionally, correction coefficients are proposed for non-standard conditions, which, in turn, results in a prediction formula with a wider range of applicability. Comparative analysis between the calculated predictions and the field observation data from an actual foundation pit project in Zhuhai City validates the feasibility of the quantitative prediction method proposed in this research, which also provides a 21% safety margin.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Circular economy (CE) is a recent model of production and consumption. According to the European Parliament, this model simply extends the life cycles of products through sharing, leasing, reusing, repairing, refurbishing, and recycling existing materials as much as possible. Digitalization plays a crucial role in the transformation towards a sustainable circular economy. By providing accurate information about appliances and machines conditions, minimizing waste and promoting a longer life for them can be achieved. Predictive maintenance (PdM) is a service using data analytics and aiming at detecting machine failures, degraded performance, or a downtrend in product quality before one of these occur. Due to the advantages that artificial intelligence (AI) techniques currently offer, more and more predictive maintenance solutions start incorporating them in order to better analyse the gathered data. This paper gives an overview of the Deep Learning toolkit that has been developed within the European project KYKLOS 4.0, and which provides a bunch of functionalities including data collection and preprocessing, models definition, and models validation. This toolkit is also endowed with a graphical user interface facilitating its use. It has also been tested with publicly available datasets as well as datasets collected in manufacturing environments. In the current paper, the toolkit will be described in the context of a pilot where the data were collected from a shipyard located in the Astander city, in Spain.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"People's busy and comfortable lifestyles in our technological era have enabled communication technology to advance to the point where any information may be accessed from anywhere in the world. Technological revolutions such as the Internet of Things and machine learning have grown in popularity in recent years due to the benefits they represent in a variety of domains of expertise. It is worth noting that implementing these two technologies encourages the development of more and better-automated systems of control in the home automation area that adapt to the preferences of each user. Many instances occur at establishments as a result of negligence and forgetfulness, when electrical equipment is left on even when there is no human presence in the room. This is one of the most prominent examples of societal electrical waste. As a result, a smart system that ensures both efficacy and efficiency must be implemented. To solve this issue, a privacy-preserving and safe identification and verification methodology for Home Automation Systems that leverages strong current technologies such as IoT, Machine Learning (ML), and Image Processing are proposed. It additionally makes utilization of more efficient image processing technologies than IR sensor-based systems for home automation. The ML Algorithm is responsible for recognizing people in each frame captured by the camera. A robust machine learning system capable of accurately distinguishing diverse environmental variables and human activities is designed to manage challenging situations.\",\n",

This study investigated and analyzed particulate matter data from Yeosu, Gwangyang, and Suncheon in Jeollanam-do, with a particular focus on PM2.5. Descriptive statistics, box-and-whisker plots, correlation matrices, time variations, and trend analyses were performed for this purpose. Additionally, a prediction model for PM2.5 concentrations was developed using machine learning techniques, through which future changes in air quality were forecasted. \\nCalculations were performed using R-based programs and R packages. Hourly PM2.5 data were obtained from air quality monitoring sites in Yeosu, Gwangyang, and Suncheon. After data preprocessing, the optimal prediction model was constructed using Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Machine from various machine learning algorithms. \\nThe research results showed that there was more PM2.5 pollution in Gwangyang compared to Yeosu and Suncheon. The PM2.5 concentrations varied significantly across each monitoring site. Among the monitoring sites, the Yeosu site showed a higher correlation in PM2.5 with each other than other sites. Late winter and early spring showed higher PM2.5 concentrations, while summer and autumn showed lower concentrations. Weekly PM2.5 concentration fluctuations were not significantly different. Daily fluctuations showed an increase in PM2.5 concentrations during times of traffic congestion and a decrease in the afternoon. During the research period, the trend of PM2.5 concentration was generally decreasing. \\nThe accuracy of the prediction model through machine learning was over 90%, and it is expected to assist in establishing effective response strategies for future changes in air quality. This study provided an updated and useful evaluation of recent PM2.5 air quality in Yeosu, Gwangyang, and Suncheon in Korea.\",\n",

However, traditional farming methods pose significant challenges, including soil fertility depletion, waterlogging, and crop damage. To modernize the sector, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) can play a crucial role. IoT's Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) can monitor soil moisture, temperature, nutrient levels, and humidity, providing real-time information about crop health and soil conditions. AI algorithms can help farmers make informed decisions about water and fertilizer use, optimize yields, reduce wastage, detect crop diseases and pests, and monitor large-scale farms using drones. The adoption of AI in agriculture has the potential to revolutionize the sector, ensuring continued growth and prosperity.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The rapid and accurate identification of the opening and closing state of the knife switch in a gas insulated switchgear (GIS) is very important for the timely detection of equipment faults and for the reduction of related accidents. However, existing technologies, such as image recognition, are vulnerable to weather or light intensity, while microswitch, attitude sensing and other methods are unable to induce equipment power failure with sufficient speed, which brings many new challenges to the operation and maintenance of a GIS. Therefore, this research designs a GIS shell vibration detection system for knife switch state discrimination, introduces a deep learning algorithm for knife switch vibration signal analysis, and proposes a fast convolutional neural network (FCNN) to identify the knife switch state. For the designed FCNN, a normalization layer and a nonlinear activation layer are used after each convolution layer to obviously reduce feature quantity and increase algorithm efficiency. In order to test the recognition performance based on the vibration detection system, this study carried out two kinds of knife switch opening and closing experiments. One group with artificial noise was added, the other group did not include artifical noise, and a corresponding data set was constructed. The experimental results show that the recognition accuracy for both datasets reaches 100%, and the FCNN algorithm is better than the five classical algorithms in terms of prediction efficiency. This study shows that the vibration detection technology based on deep learning can be used to effectively identify the opening and closing state of a GIS knife switch, and is expected to be promoted and applied.\",\n",

Significance Over the past decade, machine learning (ML) algorithms have rapidly become much more widespread for numerous biomedical applications, including the diagnosis and categorization of disease and injury. Aim Here, we seek to characterize the recent growth of ML techniques that use imaging data to classify burn wound severity and report on the accuracies of different approaches. Approach To this end, we present a comprehensive literature review of preclinical and clinical studies using ML techniques to classify the severity of burn wounds. Results The majority of these reports used digital color photographs as input data to the classification algorithms, but recently there has been an increasing prevalence of the use of ML approaches using input data from more advanced optical imaging modalities (e.g., multispectral and hyperspectral imaging, optical coherence tomography), in addition to multimodal techniques. The classification accuracy of the different methods is reported; it typically ranges from \\u223c70% to 90% relative to the current gold standard of clinical judgment. Conclusions The field would benefit from systematic analysis of the effects of different input data modalities, training/testing sets, and ML classifiers on the reported accuracy. Despite this current limitation, ML-based algorithms show significant promise for assisting in objectively classifying burn wound severity.\",\n",

This article offers an automated Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of UAV Remote Sensing for crop monitoring and diagnosis. This review analyzes the primary scientific applications and trends in this area using Deep Learning techniques to automatically select relevant articles and validate them through full reading. The SLR collected over 800 papers, of which 64 met the selection process. The articles selected by Deep Learning classifiers were successfully cataloged with high accuracy in pre-selecting articles for review. F1 scores of 93% were achieved in tests with unpublished examples for the classifier model. The review of the 64 primary studies reported a peak in UAV Remote Sensing applications in 2020, attributed to the increasing diffusion of precision farming practices with technological equipment. The UAV Remote Sensing application objectives included crop monitoring, pest and disease detection, yield prediction, and plant nutrition. Artificial Intelligence, particularly Machine Learning and Deep Learning, are widely used for UAV Remote Sensing analysis. The NDVI is the most applied vegetation index for crop condition assessment and monitoring. The proposed solution for automating the literature selection process for precision agriculture-related scientific articles can be used in other areas that require extensive literature review.\",\n",

For a long time, the research of avalanche disaster prediction in the world is insufficient, there are only some basic models and basic conditions of occurrence, and there is no long series and wide range of avalanche disaster prediction products. Based on 7 different bands and different types of multi-source remote sensing data,this study combined with existing avalanche occurrence models, field investigation and statistical data to analyze the causes of avalanche. The U-net convolutional neural network and threshold analysis were used to extract the distribution of long time series avalanch-prone areas in two study areas, Heiluogou in Sichuan Province and along the Zangpo River in Palong, Tibet Autonomous Region. In addition, the relationship between earthquake magnitude and spatial distribution and avalanche occurrence is also analyzed in this study. This study will also continue to build a prior knowledge base of avalanche occurrence conditions, improve the prediction accuracy of the two methods, and produce products in long time series interannual avalanch-prone areas in southwest China, including Sichuan Province, Yunnan Province, and Tibet Autonomous Region. The resulting products will provide high-precision avalanche prediction and safety assurance for engineering construction and mountaineering activities in Southwest China.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Intramuscular fat (IMF) content is a key determinant of pork quality. Controlling the genetic and physiological factors of IMF and the expression patterns of various genes is important for regulating the IMF content and improving meat quality in pig breeding. Growing evidence has suggested the role of genetic factors and breeds in IMF deposition; however, research on the sex factors of IMF deposition is still lacking. The present study aimed to identify potential sex-specific biomarkers strongly associated with IMF deposition in low- and high-IMF pig populations. The GSE144780 expression dataset of IMF deposition-related genes were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus. Initially, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected in male and female low-IMF (162 DEGs, including 64 up- and 98 down-regulated genes) and high-IMF pigs (202 DEGs, including 147 up- and 55 down-regulated genes). Moreover, hub genes were screened via PPI network construction. Furthermore, hub genes were screened for potential sex-specific biomarkers using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator machine learning algorithm, and sex-specific biomarkers in low-IMF (troponin I (TNNI1), myosin light chain 9(MYL9), and serpin family C member 1(SERPINC1)) and high-IMF pigs (CD4 molecule (CD4), CD2 molecule (CD2), and amine oxidase copper-containing 2(AOC2)) were identified, and then verified by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in semimembranosus muscles. Additionally, the gene set enrichment analysis and single-sample gene set enrichment analysis of hallmark gene sets were collectively performed on the identified biomarkers. Finally, the transcription factor-biomarker and lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA (biomarker) networks were predicted. The identified potential sex-specific biomarkers may provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of IMF deposition and the beneficial foundation for improving meat quality in pig breeding.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Deep learning tasks (DLT) include training and inference tasks, where training DLTs have requirements on minimizing average job completion time (JCT) and inference tasks need sufficient GPUs to meet real-time performance. Unfortunately, existing work separately deploys multi-tenant training and inference GPU cluster, leading to the high JCT of training DLTs with limited GPUs when the inference cluster is under insufficient GPU utilization due to the periodic inference workload. DeepBoot solves the challenges by utilizing idle GPUs in the inference cluster for the training DLTs. Specifically, 1) DeepBoot designs adaptive task scaling (ATS) algorithm to allocate GPUs in the training and inference clusters for training DLTs and minimize the performance loss when reclaiming inference GPUs. 2) DeepBoot implements auto-fast elastic (AFE) training based on Pollux to reduce the restart overhead by inference GPU reclaiming. Our implementation on the testbed and large-scale simulation in Microsoft deep learning workload shows that DeepBoot can achieve 32% and 38% average JCT reduction respectively compared with the scheduler without utilizing idle GPUs in the inference cluster.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The proposed study employs a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network (NN) to forecast monthly rainfall in the Barak river basin in the northeastern region of India for a prediction horizon up to 4 months in advance. Out of nine significant climate variables, sea surface temperature (SST), sea level pressure (SLP), Nino 3.4 index, the Indian summer monsoon rainfall (ISMR) anomalies and dipole mode index (DMI) were identified to be the best-suited predictors and were introduced as the inputs in the NN. The LSTM is a special kind of recurrent neural network (RNN) which specializes in feature extraction and storing memory in its cell state cumulatively. The model results display strong correlations between the potential predictor sets and the rainfall distribution across the basin. The obtained forecast results were scrutinized in terms of various statistical measures and the predictions were found to be at par with the real time observations (correlations greater than 0.90 and hit score greater than 85%). The testing phase of model produced root mean square errors in the range of 12.45% to 15.65% highlighting satisfactory model performance. The proposed method of incorporating different climate indices form a novel approach to forecast rainfall in the region which may lead to timely and effective management of water resources.\",\n",

Shallow artificial neural networks were developed, trained, and tested using data pertaining to the blended wing body (BWB) class of aerospace vehicles. Configuration design parameters were varied using a Latin-hypercube sampling scheme. These data were used by a parametric-based BWB configuration generator to create unique BWBs. Performance for each configuration was obtained via a performance estimation tool. Training and testing of neural networks was conducted using a K-fold cross-validation scheme. A random forest approach was used to determine the values of predicted configuration design variables when evaluating neural network accuracy across a blended wing body vehicle survey. The results demonstrated the viability of leveraging neural networks in mission-dependent, inverse design of blended wing bodies. In particular, feed-forward, shallow neural network architectures yielded significantly better predictive accuracy than cascade-forward architectures. Furthermore, for both architectures, increasing the number of neurons in the hidden layer increased the prediction accuracy of configuration design variables by at least 80%.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Landslide displacement prediction has garnered significant recognition as a pivotal component in realizing successful early warnings and implementing effective control measures. This task remains challenging as landslide deformation involves not only temporal dependency within time series data but also spatial dependence across various regions within landslides. The present study proposes a landslide spatiotemporal displacement forecasting model by introducing attention-based deep learning algorithms based on spatiotemporal analysis. The Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC) approach is employed to quantify the spatial and temporal correlations within the daily data of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) observations. Based on the quantitative spatiotemporal analysis, the proposed prediction model combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) network to capture spatial and temporal dependencies individually. Spatial\\u2013temporal attention mechanisms are implemented to optimize the model. Additionally, we develop a single-point prediction model using LSTM and a multiple-point prediction model using the CNN-LSTM without an attention mechanism to compare the forecasting capabilities of the attention-based CNN-LSTM model. The Outang landslide in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area (TGRA), characterized by a large and active landslide equipped with an advanced monitoring system, is taken as a studied case. The temporal MIC results shed light on the response times of monitored daily displacement to external factors, showing a lagging duration of between 10 and 50 days. The spatial MIC results indicate mutual influence among different locations within the landslide, particularly in the case of nearby sites experiencing significant deformation. The attention-based CNN-LSTM model demonstrates an impressive predictive performance across six monitoring stations within the Outang landslide area. Notably, it achieves a remarkable maximum coefficient of determination (R2) value of 0.9989, accompanied by minimum values for root mean squared error (RMSE), absolute mean error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), specifically, 1.18 mm, 0.99 mm, and 0.33%, respectively. The proposed model excels in predicting displacements at all six monitoring points, whereas other models demonstrate strong performance at specific individual stations but lack consistent performance across all stations. This study, involving quantitative deformation characteristics analysis and spatiotemporal displacement prediction, holds promising potential for a more profound understanding of landslide evolution and a significant contribution to reducing landslide risk.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Background Next-generation sequencing (NGS) panels for mature B-cell neoplasms (MBNs) are widely applied clinically but have yet to be routinely used in a manner that is suitable for subtype differential diagnosis. This study retrospectively investigated newly diagnosed cases of MBNs from our laboratory to investigate mutation landscapes in Chinese patients with MBNs and to combine mutational information and machine learning (ML) into clinical applications for MBNs, especially for subtype classification. Methods Samples from the Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer (COSMIC) database were collected for ML model construction and cases from our laboratory were used for ML model validation. Five repeats of 10-fold cross-validation Random Forest algorithm was used for ML model construction. Mutation detection was performed by NGS and tumor cell size was confirmed by cell morphology and/or flow cytometry in our laboratory. Results Totally 849 newly diagnosed MBN cases from our laboratory were retrospectively identified and included in mutational landscape analyses. Patterns of gene mutations in a variety of MBN subtypes were found, important to investigate tumorigenesis in MBNs. A long list of novel mutations was revealed, valuable to both functional studies and clinical applications. By combining gene mutation information revealed by NGS and ML, we established ML models that provide valuable information for MBN subtype classification. In total, 8895 cases of 8 subtypes of MBNs in the COSMIC database were collected and utilized for ML model construction, and the models were validated on the 849 MBN cases from our laboratory. A series of ML models was constructed in this study, and the most efficient model, with an accuracy of 0.87, was based on integration of NGS testing and tumor cell sizes. Conclusions The ML models were of great significance in the differential diagnosis of all cases and different MBN subtypes. Additionally, using NGS results to assist in subtype classification of MBNs by method of ML has positive clinical potential.\",\n",

To measure DIBs in spectra of late-type stars more accurately and more efficiently, we developed a Random Forest model to isolate the DIB features from the stellar components and applied this method to 780 thousand spectra collected by the Gaia Radial Velocity Spectrometer (RVS) that were published in the third data release (DR3). After subtracting the stellar components, we modeled the DIBs $\\\\lambda$8621 and $\\\\lambda$8648. After quality control, we selected 7619 reliable measurements. The rest-frame wavelength of DIB $\\\\lambda$8621 was updated as $\\\\lambda_0\\\\,{=}\\\\,8623.141\\\\,{\\\\pm}\\\\,0.030$ AA in vacuum, corresponding to 8620.766 AA in air, which was determined by 77 DIB measurements toward the Galactic anti-center. With the peak finding method and a coarse analysis, DIB $\\\\lambda$8621 was found to correlate better with the neutral hydrogen than the molecular hydrogen (represented by $^{12}$CO $J\\\\,{=}\\\\,(1{-}0)$ emission). We also obtained 179 reliable measurements of DIB $\\\\lambda$8648 in the RVS spectra of individual stars for the first time, further confirming this very broad DIB feature. A rough estimation of $\\\\lambda_0$ for DIB $\\\\lambda$8648 was 8646.31 AA in vacuum, corresponding to 8643.93 AA in air, assuming that the carriers of $\\\\lambda$8621 and $\\\\lambda$8648 are co-moving. We confirmed the impact of stellar residuals on the DIB measurements in Gaia DR3, which led to a distortion of the DIB profile and a shift of the center ($\\\\lesssim0.5$ AA), but the EW was consistent with our new measurements. With our measurements and analyses, we propose that the machine-learning-based approach can be widely applied to measure DIBs in numerous spectra from spectroscopic surveys.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"There is an exciting synergy between deep learning and robotics, combining the perception skills a deep learning system can achieve with the wide variety of physical responses a robot can perform. This article describes an embedded system integrated into a mobile robot capable of identifying and following a specific person reliably based on a convolutional neural network pipeline. In addition, the design incorporates an optical tracking system for supporting the inferences of the neural networks, allowing the determination of the position of a person using an RGB depth camera. The system runs on an NVIDIA Jetson TX2 board, an embedded System-on-Module capable of performing computationally demanding tasks onboard and handling the complexity needed to run a solid tracking and following algorithm. A robotic mobile base with the Jetson TX2 board attached receives velocity orders to move the system toward the target. The proposed approach has been validated on a mobile robotic platform that successfully follows a determined person, relying on the robustness of the combination of deep learning with optical tracking for working efficiently in a real environment.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Transformers have achieved significant success in deep learning, and training Transformers efficiently on resource-constrained platforms has been attracting continuous attention for domain adaptions and privacy concerns. However, deploying Transformers training on these platforms is still challenging due to its dynamic workloads, intensive computations, and massive memory accesses. To address these issues, we propose an Efficient Training Accelerator for TRansformers (TRETA) through a hardware-algorithm co-optimization strategy. First, a hardware-friendly mixed-precision training algorithm is presented based on a compact and efficient data format, which significantly reduces the computation and memory requirements. Second, a flexible and scalable architecture is proposed to achieve high utilization of computing resources when processing arbitrary irregular general matrix multiplication (GEMM) operations during training. These irregular GEMMs lead to severe under-utilization when simply mapped on traditional systolic architectures. Third, we develop training-oriented architectures for the crucial Softmax and layer normalization functions in Transformers, respectively. These area-efficient modules have unified and flexible microarchitectures to meet various computation requirements of different training phases. Finally, TRETA is implemented under Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) 28-nm technology and evaluated on multiple benchmarks. The experimental results show that our training framework achieves the same accuracy as the full precision baseline. Moreover, TRETA can achieve 14.71 tera operations per second (TOPS) and 3.31 TOPS/W in terms of throughput and energy efficiency, respectively. Compared with prior arts, the proposed design shows 1.4\\u2013 $24.5\\\\times $ speedup and 1.5\\u2013 $25.4\\\\times $ energy efficiency improvement.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Accurately predicting functional outcomes in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) helps clinicians set realistic functional recovery goals and improve the home environment after discharge. The present study aimed to develop and validate machine learning (ML) models to predict functional outcomes in patients with SCI and deploy the models within a web application. The study included data from the Japan Association of Rehabilitation Database from January 1, 1991 to December 31, 2015. Patients with SCI who were admitted to an SCI center or were transferred to a participating postacute rehabilitation hospital after receiving acute treatment were enrolled in this database. The primary outcome was functional ambulation at discharge from the rehabilitation hospital. The secondary outcome was the total motor Functional Independence Measure (FIM) score at discharge. We used binary classification models to predict whether functional ambulation was achieved, as well as regression models to predict total motor FIM scores at discharge. In the training dataset (70% random sample), using demographic characteristics and neurological and functional status as predictors, we built prediction performance matrices of multiple ML models and selected the best one for each outcome. We validated each model's predictive performance in the test dataset (the remaining 30%). Among the 4181 patients, 3827 were included in the prediction model for the total motor FIM score. The mean (SD) age was 50.4 (18.7) years, and 3211 (83.9%) patients were male. There were 3122 patients included in the prediction model for functional ambulation. The CatBoost Classifier and regressor models showed the best performances in the training dataset. On the test dataset, the CatBoost Classifier had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.8452 and an accuracy of 0.7663 for predicting functional ambulation. Likewise, the CatBoost Regressor performed well, with an R2 of 0.7746, a mean absolute error of 9.4895, and a root mean square error of 13.5312 for predicting the total motor FIM score. The final models were deployed in a web application to provide functional predictions. The application can be found at http://www.ortho.m.chiba-u.jp/general/4560. In conclusion, our prediction models developed using ML successfully predicted functional outcomes in patients with SCI and were deployed in an open-access web application.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Creating computational biology models applicable to industry is much more difficult than it appears. There is a major gap between a model that looks good on paper and a model that performs well in the drug discovery process. We are trying to shrink this gap by introducing the Evaluation Framework For predicting Efficiency of Cancer Treatment (EFFECT) benchmark suite based on the DepMap and GDSC data sets to facilitate the creation of well-applicable machine learning models capable of predicting gene essentiality and/or drug sensitivity on in vitro cancer cell lines. We show that standard evaluation metrics like Pearson correlation are misleading due to inherent biases in the data. Thus, to assess the performance of models properly, we propose the use of cell line/perturbation exclusive data splits, perturbation-wise evaluation, and the application of our Bias Detector framework, which can identify model predictions not explicable by data bias alone. Testing the EFFECT suite on a few popular machine learning (ML) models showed that while library-standard non-linear models have measurable performance in splits representing precision medicine and target identification tasks, the actual corrected correlations are rather low, showing that even simple knock-out (KO)/drug sensitivity prediction is a yet unsolved task. For this reason, we aim our proposed framework to be a unified test and evaluation pipeline for ML models predicting cancer sensitivity data, facilitating unbiased benchmarking to support teams to improve on the state of the art.\",\n",

Through a systematic literature review, different approaches for extracting rules from feedforward neural networks, an important block in deep learning models, are identified and explored. The findings reveal a range of methods developed for over two decades, mostly suitable for shallow neural networks, with recent developments to meet deep learning models' challenges. Rules offer a transparent and intuitive means of explaining neural networks, making this study a comprehensive introduction for researchers interested in the field. While the study specifically addresses feedforward networks with supervised learning and crisp rules, future work can extend to other network types, machine learning methods, and fuzzy rule extraction.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Existing studies often lack a systematic solution for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) inspection system, which hinders their widespread application in crack detection. To enhance its substantial practicality, this study proposes a formal and systematic framework for UAV inspection systems, specifically designed for automatic crack detection and pavement distress evaluation. The framework integrates UAV data acquisition, deep-learning-based crack identification, and road damage assessment in a comprehensive and orderly manner. Firstly, a flight control strategy is presented, and road crack data are collected using DJI Mini 2 UAV imagery, establishing high-quality UAV crack image datasets with ground truth information. Secondly, a validation and comparison study is conducted to enhance the automatic crack detection capability and provide an appropriate deployment scheme for UAV inspection systems. This study develops automatic crack detection models based on mainstream deep learning algorithms (namely, Faster-RCNN, YOLOv5s, YOLOv7-tiny, and YOLOv8s) in urban road scenarios. The results demonstrate that the Faster-RCNN algorithm achieves the highest accuracy and is suitable for the online data collection of UAV and offline inspection at work stations. Meanwhile, the YOLO models, while slightly lower in accuracy, are the fastest algorithms and are suitable for the lightweight deployment of UAV with online collection and real-time inspection. Quantitative measurement methods for road cracks are presented to assess road damage, which will enhance the application of UAV inspection systems and provide factual evidence for the maintenance decisions made by road authorities.\",\n",

To predict these complex targets, the common solution is to design a complex neural network, or use a real network to separately predict the real and imaginary parts of the target. But in this paper, we propose to use a real network to estimate the magnitude mask and normalized cIRM, which not only avoids the significant increase of the model complexity caused by complex networks, but also shows better performance than previous phase estimation methods. Meanwhile, we devise a parallel sequence modeling (PSM) block to improve the RNN block in the convolutional recurrent network (CRN)-based SE model. We name our method as magnitude-and-phase-aware and PSM-based CRN (MPCRN). The experimental results illustrate that our MPCRN has superior SE performance.\",\n",

The shaped charge jet analog comprises a copper liner, a high explosive (HE), and a silicone buffer. We apply a genetic algorithm to determine an optimal buffer design that can be placed between the liner and the HE that results in the largest possible change in jet velocity. The use of a genetic algorithm allows for discoveries of unintuitive, complex, yet optimal buffer designs. Experiments using the optimal design verified the effectiveness of the buffer and validated the machine learning approach to hydrodynamic design optimization.\",\n",

We present an extended framework that combines the advantages of PINNs with the detailed consideration of experimental parameter variations for the simulation and prediction of chemical reaction kinetics. The approach is based on truncated Taylor series expansions for the underlying fundamental equations, whereby the external variations can be interpreted as perturbations of the kinetic parameters. Accordingly, our method allows for an efficient consideration of experimental parameter settings and their influence on the concentration profiles and reaction kinetics. A particular advantage of our approach, in addition to the consideration of univariate and multivariate parameter variations, is the robust model-based exploration of the parameter space to determine optimal reaction conditions in combination with advanced reaction insights. The benefits of this concept are demonstrated for higher-order chemical reactions including catalytic and oscillatory systems in combination with small amounts of training data. All predicted values show a high level of accuracy, demonstrating the broad applicability and flexibility of our approach.\",\n",

On this basis, it then selects data from the day of article publication to further study the impact of article dissemination on donation behavior from the perspective of reading quantity, and analyzes the influencing factors of article reading quantity.FindingsThe results show that on the same day that an article is published, there is an increase of 13.8 and 14.3% in blood donation volume and fan registrations, respectively. The mediating effect exists. However, the day after an article is published, there is no longer any effect on blood donations. With a 1% increase in reading quantity, blood donation volume on the day of article publication increases by 0.13%, and this positive impact is promoted by the quality of the articles. A conc ise articles title and body and rich images help drive reading quantity. Moreover, blood donors prefer to read articles about blood dynamics and donation promotion, while articles about news, announcements and administrative affairs make them less inclined to read.Originality/valueFirst, it focuses on WPPA, quantifies the impact of articles on blood donation behavior and analyzes the mechanism. Second, the authors study the impact and timeliness of social media article dissemination to address the insufficiency of existing research. Third, the study provides a scientific basis for the editing and publishing of articles, helping blood banks improve the effectiveness of publicity and recruitment.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Classifying images of Thai culture is important for a variety of applications, such as tourism, education, and cultural preservation. However, building a Machine learning model from scratch to classify Thai cultural images can be challenging due to the limited availability of annotated data. In this study, we investigate the use of transfer learning for the task of image classification on a dataset of Thai cultural images. We utilize three popular convolutional neural network models, namely MobileNet, EfficientNet, and residual network (ResNet) as baseline pre-trained models. Their performances were evaluated when they were trained from random initialization, used as a feature extractor, and fully fine-tuned. The results showed that all three models performed better in terms of accuracy and training time when they were used as a feature extractor, with EfficientNet achieving the highest accuracy of 95.87% while maintaining the training time of 24 ms/iteration. To better understand the reasoning behind the predictions made by the models, we deployed the gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) visualization technique to generate heatmaps that the models attend to when making predictions. Both our quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrated that transfer learning is an effective approach to image classification on Thai cultural images.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"In the DataBeach study a machine learning model was developed with the aim to improve the efficiency and sustainability of design of soft coastal defense projects. A morphological model based on machine learning was trained and tested to predict beach volume changes with significantly reduced computational time compared to traditional process-based models. The machine learning model was then applied, combined with a \\u2018penalty function\\u2019 for inclusion of morphological feedback, to predict beach volume changes for the study area of approximately 2 km alongshore and on a 10-year project timescale. In order to run many different scenarios for the 10-year prediction, a probabilistic methodology was developed to take into account the uncertainties in this time period. The machine learning-based model provides great benefits for probabilistic simulations, due to the lower computational time, compared to process-based numerical models such as XBeach, and a flexible way in which it can incorporate measurement data. The performance of the tested machine learning models was comparable to that of the short term volume predictions of XBeach. Comparison of 10-year predicted volume changes using the machine learning model and measured beach topography (LiDAR) showed good agreement between measured and predicted volume changes for the dry beach area (when accounting for nourishments), but overestimation in the beach volume change predictions for the intertidal beach. These differences are partially attributed to the poor performance on XBeach for long term, normal wave conditions, which are an important factor in the intertidal area.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"PURPOSE. Currently, modeling is one of the most reliable ways to study normal and emergency modes of operation of electrical networks. In this regard, a mathematical model of the 0.4 kV rural electric network was developed in the MATLAB Simulink program.PURPOSE. Evaluation of the accuracy of the parameters of the operating modes of the 0.4 kV rural electric network obtained by modeling in MATLAB Simulink by estimating the values of the steady-state single-phase short circuit current at different distances from the transformer substation.METHODS. The currents obtained using the 0.4 kV electrical network model developed in MATLAB Simulink were compared with the currents obtained using other calculation methods (according to GOST 28249-93, the simplified phase-zero loop method and the mathematical model \\u00abProject RZA\\u00bb).RESULTS. It was revealed that the discrepancy in the results at individual points was 9-11%. When simulating a steady-state single-phase short circuit in MATLAB Simulink, it was found that the voltage of the damaged phase A decreases to 0 V, while the voltages on the two remaining intact phases increase by 1.4-1.5 times, i.e.E. by a factor of 2 to the values of 335-354 V when short-circuiting at the transformer terminals and to the values of 329-338 V when short-circuiting behind a section of a 0.4 kV power line.CONCLUSIONS. The resulting mathematical model of a 0.4 kV rural electric network in the MATLAB Simulink program can be used to study normal and emergency operating modes, study the modes of joint operation of renewable energy sources with a centralized network, and the processes of switching on backup generation sources.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Marathi is one of India's most ancient languages. This research project (TTS) focuses at the growth of the Marathi Text-to-Speech system. Marathi text produced in either Devanagari or Ekalipi script is used as input for Marathi TTS. The Text to Speech system's purpose is to convert any given text into speech. In order to mimic human speakers, speech synthesis involves creating technology that can produce human-like speech from any text input. Two key elements of a text-to-speech system are text processing and speech production. It is crucial that the text processing component provides an adequate sequence of phonemic units in order to construct a speech synthesis system that produces natural-sounding speech. The Hidden Markov Model is used with the statistical parameters for speech synthesis. This research is conducted to improve the pronunciation accuracy. The primary goal of this research is to improve and fine-tune the TTS system's pronunciation accuracy for native Indian languages like Marathi and make it seem more natural than current TTS systems (like how humans speak). The WASRAW (\\\"Write as Spoken, Read as Written\\\") technique is what the TTS system uses to speak written text. The objective is to create a language-independent solution as opposed to current solutions, particularly with regard to pronunciation. Unique script i.e., Ekalipi script has been used along with Devanagari script for Marathi language. The proposed model has been tested for 35 Marathi speakers for Devanagari script and achieved MOS of 4.38 for speech intelligibility, MOS of 4.45 for pronunciation accuracy and MOS of 4.44 for naturalness. Also, for Ekalipi script it has been tested for around 10 users who are familiar with the script. The dictionary-based approach has been followed in order to speak Ekalipi words. It has achieved good results for simple words written in Ekalipi. Even though the system is able to synthesize Ekalipi words correctly, there is still a need for a generalized model. As a future work, rules can be defined and the generalized model can be implemented for Ekalipi script and can be tested with the more no users and more no of languages can be added.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Health insurance is crucial for each person, bearing in mind the increasing medical costs. COVID-19 has been an eye-opener as to how important it is to have health insurance. Medical emergencies can have a severe emotional and financial impact. Thus, a health insurance policy can help mitigate financial risks in unpredictable circumstances. However, the current insurance system is very expensive, as thousands of people pay the premiums, and very few take the claims. Furthermore, the claim settlement process is excruciatingly long and tiresome. In this article, we focus on establishing a rapid and cost-effective framework for the health insurance market, based on machine learning and blockchain technology. By developing a smart contract, blockchain may eliminate any third-party organizations and make the complete process safer, easier, and more efficient. The contract pays the claim based on the claimant\\u2019s documentation. We optimized the premiums using a regression model based on the net amount claimed during the current policy tenure and various other criteria. For anticipating risk, a random forest classifier is used, which aids in the risk-rated premium rebate computation for policyholders for their next term of insurance.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"This review paper explores the role of human taste panels and artificial neural networks (ANNs) in taste-masking paediatric drug formulations. Given the ethical, practical, and regulatory challenges of employing children, young adults (18\\u201340) can serve as suitable substitutes due to the similarity in their taste sensitivity. Taste panellists need not be experts in sensory evaluation so long as a reference product is used during evaluation; however, they should be screened for bitterness taste detection thresholds. For a more robust evaluation during the developmental phase, considerations of a scoring system and the calculation of an acceptance value may be beneficial in determining the likelihood of recommending a formulation for further development. On the technological front, artificial neural networks (ANNs) can be exploited in taste-masking optimisation of medicinal formulations as they can model complex relationships between variables and enable predictions not possible previously to optimise product profiles. Machine learning classifiers may therefore tackle the challenge of predicting the bitterness intensity of paediatric formulations. While advancements have been made, further work is needed to identify effective taste-masking techniques for specific drug molecules. Continuous refinement of machine learning algorithms, using human panellist acceptability scores, can aid in enhancing paediatric formulation development and overcoming taste-masking challenges.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Task\\u2010incremental learning (Task\\u2010IL) aims to enable an intelligent agent to continuously accumulate knowledge from new learning tasks without catastrophically forgetting what it has learned in the past. It has drawn increasing attention in recent years, with many algorithms being proposed to mitigate neural network forgetting. However, none of the existing strategies is able to completely eliminate the issues. Moreover, explaining and fully understanding what knowledge and how it is being forgotten during the incremental learning process still remains under\\u2010explored. In this paper, we propose KnowledgeDrift, a visual analytics framework, to interpret the network forgetting with three objectives: (1) to identify when the network fails to memorize the past knowledge, (2) to visualize what information has been forgotten, and (3) to diagnose how knowledge attained in the new model interferes with the one learned in the past. Our analytical framework first identifies the occurrence of forgetting by tracking the task performance under the incremental learning process and then provides in\\u2010depth inspections of drifted information via various levels of data granularity. KnowledgeDrift allows analysts and model developers to enhance their understanding of network forgetting and compare the performance of different incremental learning algorithms. Three case studies are conducted in the paper to further provide insights and guidance for users to effectively diagnose catastrophic forgetting over time.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Understanding the intricate operations of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) mechanistically is pivotal for advancing their capabilities and applications. In this pursuit, we propose the Episodic Memory Theory (EMT), illustrating that RNNs can be conceptualized as discrete-time analogs of the recently proposed General Sequential Episodic Memory Model. To substantiate EMT, we introduce a novel set of algorithmic tasks tailored to probe the variable binding behavior in RNNs. Utilizing the EMT, we formulate a mathematically rigorous circuit that facilitates variable binding in these tasks. Our empirical investigations reveal that trained RNNs consistently converge to the variable binding circuit, thus indicating universality in the dynamics of RNNs. Building on these findings, we devise an algorithm to define a privileged basis, which reveals hidden neurons instrumental in the temporal storage and composition of variables, a mechanism vital for the successful generalization in these tasks. We show that the privileged basis enhances the interpretability of the learned parameters and hidden states of RNNs. Our work represents a step toward demystifying the internal mechanisms of RNNs and, for computational neuroscience, serves to bridge the gap between artificial neural networks and neural memory models.\",\n",

Fishing quotas are unpleasant but efficient to control the productivity of a fishing site. A popular model has a vector-valued stochastic differential equation for the biomass of the different species. Optimization of quota will be obtained by a gradient method applied to the least square difference with an ideal state weighted by the probability density of the biomasses. Alternatively a deep neural network which preserves the Markov property of the problem can be trained with a stochastic gradient algorithm. The model is extended to distributed fishing sites and biomass is stabilized by adjusting the quota to its time derivative.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"With the increasing rate and types of cyber attacks against information systems and communication infrastructures, many tools are needed to detect and mitigate against such attacks, for example, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). Unfortunately, traditional Signature\\u2010based IDSs (SIDSs) perform poorly against previously unseen adversarial attacks. Anomaly\\u2010based IDSs (AIDSs) use Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) approaches to overcome these limitations. However, AIDS performance can be poor when trained on imbalanced datasets. To address the challenge of AIDS performance caused by these unbalanced training datasets, generative adversarial models are proposed to obtain adversarial attacks from one side and analyse their quality from another. According to extensive usage and reliability criteria for generative adversarial models in different disciplines, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Bidirectional GAN (BiGAN), and Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) are employed to serve AIDS. The authors have extensively assessed their abilities and robustness to deliver high\\u2010quality attacks for AIDS. AIDSs are constructed, trained, and tuned based on these models to measure their impacts. The authors have employed two datasets: NSL\\u2010KDD and CICIDS\\u20102017 for generalisation purposes, where ML and DL approaches are utilised to implement AIDSs. Their results show that the WGAN model outperformed GANs and BiGAN models in binary and multiclass classifications for both datasets.\",\n",

      "      \"title\": \"How to make sense of the ethical issues raised by artificial intelligence in medicine\",\n",
      "      \"abstract\": \"Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI), including large language models such as ChatGPT, have generated intense interest, as well as urgent expressions of concern at all levels of society. Alarm has been expressed about possible implications for the way we conduct our lives, our personal relationships and how we might make decisions. Questions have been asked about whether machines will seize control of human affairs, compromise freedom and eliminate the domain of ethical decisionmaking. There has been speculation about the possibility of dangerous, unpredictable consequences for the species and the environment. The concerns have become so intense that several high-profile business people, scientists, engineers and others have called for a moratorium on the development of AI to allow a public debate to take place about its future direction and regulation. Medicine is among the many areas in which questions about the implications of AI have been raised. What effect, for example, will ChatGPT have on clinical care? Will it improve or undermine the quality and efficiency of decision-making? Will it increase or erode individual agency? Will it enhance or obstruct communication between doctors and patients? Will it support a fairer allocation of resources or will it merely exacerbate existing inequities? Ultimately, will it generate better or worse outcomes? None of these questions can be answered with confidence at the present time. In part, this is because our experience with AI in the clinic remains relatively limited. To be sure, decision support algorithms have been in use for some time to assist with diagnosis in specialised contexts, robots have been used in surgery for many years and search engines and databases have long provided access to information where required. However, the powerful recent developments have for the most part so far failed to penetrate the clinic, and their possible implications remain to be fully elaborated. Our ability to respond is also limited because of the sheer complexity of the questions. The small industry that has sprung up around the ethical uncertainties provoked by AI provides little relief. The mere listing of familiar issues, such as \\u2018autonomy\\u2019, \\u2018consent\\u2019, \\u2018justice\\u2019 and \\u2018privacy\\u2019, and the routine application of standardised ethical principles are incapable of providing compelling answers. The call for a moratorium by billionaire businessmen does little to increase confidence, instead merely raising further questions about who is to undertake the supposed \\u2018public debate\\u2019 and according to whose values or what standards the ultimate decisions will be made. To respond effectively to the challenges of AI we need to undertake a more fundamental reflection about what we most value about medicine and what we consider to be its main points of vulnerability. It will also be important to clarify what aspects of medicine ChatGPT and other AI structures may seek to supplement or replace. It is possible that this process of questioning will itself give rise to useful insights, about not only AI but also the nature of clinical practice and the values, goals and purposes we believe we should be serving. The reflections that are required are inherently ethical. This will be in no way surprising to clinicians, whose everyday practices are inexorably saturated with discussions about values. It is a basic fact of clinical life that decisions are never purely \\u2018technical\\u2019 in nature but always need to consider the broader contexts of the lives of patients and their families, including their values, cultural norms, religious beliefs, loyalties, deep emotional attachments and fears, hopes and aspirations. Such decisions are arrived at through dialogue with physicians, who inhabit complex lifeworlds of their own, impregnated with culture, experience and values. All clinical encounters are premised on large-scale, value-laden assumptions about relationships, health and illness, equity and justice. They are always inscribed within frameworks that set out professional obligations and duties and limit or regulate certain forms of conduct. They take for granted irreducible bonds of trust and responsibility underlying every human interaction and process of communication. In addition, all forms of medical practice involve bodies \\u2013 bodies in pain, bodies with desire, bodies in need, bodies facing death, bodies appealing to other bodies. The activity of \\u2018patient-centring\\u2019, the promotion of which has become a modern clich\\u00e9, is not merely a computational or cerebral activity: it is the result of an active sharing of value-saturated experiences in real time by two or more embodied individuals. In the complex and dynamic context of the clinic, all of these issues are routinely negotiated, often with vividness and intensity. In every case, the validity of the conclusions that are drawn,\",\n",

The complicated nonlinear dynamics of battery parameters is well captured by a flexible, efficient, and expressive structure of the Fourier neural operators. Extensive numerical experiments and tests with publicly available data as well as with our own data are conducted to demonstrate the noise-tolerance, time window independence, temperature generalization, and transfer learning features of the proposed method. Our proposed method performs better than the other methods considered previously its performances is competitive with any state-of-the-art machine learning-based methods.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Pedestrian trajectory prediction in multiple scenarios is of immense importance in autonomous driving and disentanglement of human behavior but is limited in catching human intention and initiative. Most previous works tend to predict the trajectory using only 2D coordinates, which generally cause two common problems: a) Overlooking the subjective initiative, including sudden swerve and erratic movement; b) A potential challenge called abnormal collision caused by unlabeled pedestrians on dataset is not being identified and resolved, which would ruin the model prediction. To break those limitations, we introduce visual localization and orientation as Visual Intention Knowledge to help the trajectory prediction, which is learned directly from visual scenarios. It benefits to comprehend human intention and formulates decision-making processes. Moreover, by learning from the visual information and decision-making policy, we construct the Visual Intention Knowledge associated spatio-temporal Transformer (VIKT) to predict human trajectory by combining the intention knowledge with the novel Transformer. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our VIKT model could achieve competitive performance by the Visual Intention Knowledge through optimizing the model prediction compared with state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction accuracy on ETH/UCY and SDD benchmarks.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"BACKGROUND\\nThe objective of this study was to develop and validate a machine learning (ML) model for predict in-hospital mortality among critically ill patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) combined with chronic kidney disease (CKD).\\n\\n\\nMETHODS\\nAfter employing least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression for feature selection, six distinct methodologies were employed in the construction of the model. The selection of the optimal model was based on the area under the curve (AUC). Furthermore, the interpretation of the chosen model was facilitated through the utilization of SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) values and the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) algorithm.\\n\\n\\nRESULTS\\nThis study collected data and enrolled 5041 patients on CHF combined with CKD from 2008 to 2019, utilizing the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care Unit. After selection, 22 of the 47 variables collected post-intensive care unit admission were identified as mortality-associated and subsequently utilized in the development of ML models. Among the six models generated, the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model demonstrated the highest AUC at 0.837. Notably, the SHAP values highlighted the sequential organ failure assessment score, age, simplified acute physiology score II, and urine output as the four most influential variables in the XGBoost model. In addition, the LIME algorithm explains the individualized predictions.\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nIn conclusion, our study accomplished the successful development and validation of ML models for predicting in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients with CHF combined with CKD. Notably, the XGBoost model emerged as the most efficacious among all the ML models employed.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Designing reliable and energy-efficient memristors for artificial synaptic arrays in neuromorphic computing beyond von Neumann architecture remains a challenge. Here, memristors based on emerging layered nickel phosphorus trisulfide (NiPS3 ) are reported that exhibit several favorable characteristics, including uniform bipolar nonvolatile switching with small operating voltage (<1\\u00a0V), fast switching speed (< 20\\u00a0ns), high On/Off ratio (>102 ), and the ability to achieve programmable multilevel resistance states. Through direct experimental evidence using transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, it is revealed that the resistive switching mechanism in the Ti/NiPS3 /Au device is related to the formation and dissolution of Ti conductive filaments. Intriguingly, further investigation into the microstructural and chemical properties of NiPS3 suggests that the penetration of Ti ions is accompanied by the drift of phosphorus-sulfur ions, leading to induced P/S vacancies that facilitate the formation of conductive filaments. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the memristor, when operating in quasi-reset mode, effectively emulates long-term synaptic weight plasticity. By utilizing a crossbar array, multipattern memorization and multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operations are successfully implemented. Moreover, owing to the highly linear and symmetric multiple conductance states, a high pattern recognition accuracy of \\u224896.4% is demonstrated in artificial neural network simulation for neuromorphic systems.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"For mooring systems, the relationship between chain axial resistance and confining stress affects the tension transfer of embedded mooring chain, and an effective width parameter Et was adopted to reflect the complex geometry of the chain. However, the relationship in carbonate sand is fully understood. Designed as an element test, monotonic and cyclic loading tests were conducted to investigate the variation of chain axial resistance with confining stress under different conditions in South China Sea carbonate sand. Peak effective width parameter and secant coefficient were particularly analyzed to describe the gradual mobilization. The results show that the Et value in South China Sea carbonate sand has a mean increase of 15% compared with Pingtan quartz sand, which makes the chain harder to pull into the carbonate sand. The irregular particle shape may contribute to the higher axial resistance. In cyclic tests, the peak post-cyclic Et-m is larger than that of monotonic test under lower confining stress, but is smaller under higher stress. This paper provides some references to chain profile prediction in the carbonate sand.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The classification problem for short time-window steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) is important in practical applications because shorter time-window often means faster response speed. By combining the advantages of the local feature learning ability of convolutional neural network (CNN) and the feature importance distinguishing ability of attention mechanism, a novel network called AttentCNN is proposed to further improve the classification performance for short time-window SSVEP. Considering the frequency-domain features extracted from short time-window signals are not obvious, this network starts with the time-domain feature extraction module based on the filter bank (FB). The FB consists of four sixth-order Butterworth filters with different bandpass ranges. Then extracted multimodal features are aggregated together. The second major module is a set of residual squeeze and excitation blocks (RSEs) that has the ability to improve the quality of extracted features by learning the interdependence between features. The final major module is time-domain CNN (tCNN) that consists of four CNNs for further feature extraction and followed by a fully connected (FC) layer for output. Our designed networks are validated over two large public datasets, and necessary comparisons are given to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed network. In the end, in order to demonstrate the application potential of the proposed strategy in the medical rehabilitation field, we design a novel five-finger bionic hand and connect it to our trained network to achieve the control of bionic hand by human brain signals directly. Our source codes are available on Github: https://github.com/JiannanChen/AggtCNN.git.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"\\n Brain functional connectivity under the naturalistic paradigm has been illustrated to be better at predicting individual behaviors than other brain states, such as rest and task. Nevertheless, the state-of-the-art methods are difficult to achieve desirable results from movie-watching paradigm fMRI (mfMRI) induced brain functional connectivity, especially when the datasets are fewer. Incorporating other physical measurements into the prediction method may enhance accuracy. Eye tracking, becoming popular due to its portability and less expense, can provide abundant behavioral features related to the output of human's cognition, and thus might supplement the mfMRI in observing subjects\\u2019 subconscious behaviors. However, there are very few works on how to effectively integrate the multimodal information to strengthen the performance by a unified framework. To this end, a fusion approach with mfMRI and eye tracking, based on Convolution with Edge-Node Switching in Graph Neural Networks (CensNet), is proposed in this article, with subjects taken as nodes, mfMRI derived functional connectivity as node feature, different eye tracking features used to compute similarity between subjects to construct heterogeneous graph edges. By taking multiple graphs as different channels, we introduce squeeze-and-excitation attention module to CensNet (A-CensNet) to integrate graph embeddings from multiple channels into one. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the one using single modality, single channel and state-of-the-art methods. The results suggest that brain functional activities and eye behaviors might complement each other in interpreting trait-like phenotypes.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The intersection of nonlinear analysis and artificial intelligence (AI) presents a promising frontier in the rapidly changing field of technology, with the potential to yield ground-breaking solutions in a multitude of fields. In order to investigate how different disciplines may work together to transform technological progress, this study explores the synthesis of these fields. Deeper comprehension of complicated patterns and behaviours is made possible by the intersection of AI and nonlinear analysis, which can both model complex systems and events. This combination has the potential to go beyond conventional linear thinking and open doors to solve complex problems. Through the utilisation of AI's learning skills to augment nonlinear models, a novel approach to problem-solving is revealed. The purpose of the paper is to examine the applications of this synergy in various disciplines. The combination of nonlinear analysis and AI holds the potential to transform a number of industries, from banking and predictive analytics to biological systems research and autonomous vehicle development. This investigation also includes the societal and ethical ramifications of using such cutting-edge technologies. It aims to provide a thorough understanding of the factors necessary for the ethical integration of these advances into our lives by delving into concerns of privacy, prejudice, and responsible use. This study tries to give academics, engineers, and innovators a full road map by looking at recent advances and possible future possibilities. It seeks to stimulate novel research directions, interdisciplinary teamwork, and the advancement of ground-breaking technical innovations that have the potential to fundamentally alter our understanding of and interactions with the environment around us.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Self-play is a technique for machine learning in multi-agent systems where a learning algorithm learns by interacting with copies of itself. Self-play is useful for generating large quantities of data for learning, but has the drawback that the agents the learner will face post-training may have dramatically different behavior than the learner came to expect by interacting with itself. For the special case of two-player constant-sum games, self-play that reaches Nash equilibrium is guaranteed to produce strategies that perform well against any post-training opponent; however, no such guarantee exists for multiplayer games. We show that in games that approximately decompose into a set of two-player constant-sum games (called constant-sum polymatrix games) where global $\\\\epsilon$-Nash equilibria are boundedly far from Nash equilibria in each subgame (called subgame stability), any no-external-regret algorithm that learns by self-play will produce a strategy with bounded vulnerability. For the first time, our results identify a structural property of multiplayer games that enable performance guarantees for the strategies produced by a broad class of self-play algorithms. We demonstrate our findings through experiments on Leduc poker.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"\\n \\n \\n Life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias (LTVA) are a leading cause of mortality, but early identification of high-risk individuals remains a major challenge. An ECG index, TMV (T-wave morphology variations), predicts LTVA in 51,794 individuals without known cardiovascular disease from the UK Biobank (UKB) within a 10-year follow up (cohort 1), with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.558 and a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.57. Machine learning on the ECG has shown a high accuracy in detecting patients with cardiovascular disease, but its LTVA predictive value in a low-risk population and comparisons with hypothesis-driven risk markers, like TMV, is unknown.\\n \\n \\n \\n We tested the LTVA predictive value of a score combining a multi-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) model and TMV in individuals without known cardiovascular disease.\\n \\n \\n \\n Using UKB we split the individuals from cohort 1 into training (90%) and internal test (10%) sets (Figure 1). In the training set, we applied 10-fold cross validation to train a multi-layer CNN with an attention layer, where the input was a 15-second ECG at rest (lead I), and the output was occurrence (or not) of LTVA within a 10-year follow-up. We used 10-second ECG data (lead I) from an independent cohort of 32,209 individuals without cardiovascular disease from UKB (cohort 2) as an external test set (median follow-up was 3.4 years), where we also calculated TMV. We next combined them into a score (weighted by their relative contribution to LTVA in a logistic regression). The AUC, and Cox regression HRs were calculated to estimate the performance of the CNN, TMV and the combined score.\\n \\n \\n \\n In cohort 1, 217 subjects had a LTVA during the follow-up period. In the internal test set, the AUC of the CNN was 0.707. In the external test set (60 LTVA events during the follow-up period), the CNN\\u2019s prediction and TMV led to AUCs of 0.610 and 0.604, respectively. Interestingly, the CNN\\u2019s prediction and TMV were not correlated (\\u03c1 = 0.005), and the combined score led to an AUC of 0.627. We set a threshold at the score value that maximised sensitivity and specificity, and survival analyses showed a HR of 3.007 (P < 0.0001) for individuals in the score+ (score > threshold) versus those in the score- (score < threshold) group, after adjusting for age and gender (Figure 2). The continuous score also predicted LTVA independently from age and gender.\\n \\n \\n \\n A CNN-based model predicts LTVA in a low-risk population independently from TMV, a strong ECG risk predictor derived from knowledge on the underlying electrophysiology. When TMV and the CNN are combined into a score, the LTVA risk stratification improves, independently from age and gender. Our findings support the combination of hypothesis-based risk markers and CNN approaches to optimise LTVA prediction in a low-risk population.Study designSurvival curves\\n\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe public health issue in the world. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) offers a way to study brain differences between AD patients and healthy individuals through feature extraction and comparison. However, in most previous works, the extracted features were not aimed to be causal, hindering biological understanding and interpretation. In order to extract causal features, we propose using instrumental variable (IV) regression with genetic variants as IVs. Specifically, we propose Deep Feature Extraction via Instrumental Variable Regression (DeepFEIVR), which uses a nonlinear neural network to extract causal features from three\\u2010dimensional neuroimages to predict an outcome (eg, AD status in our application) while maintaining a linear relationship between the extracted features and IVs. DeepFEIVR not only can handle high dimensional individual\\u2010level data for model building, but also is applicable to GWAS summary data to test associations of the extracted features with the outcome in subsequent analysis. In addition, we propose an extension of DeepFEIVR, called DeepFEIVR\\u2010CA, for covariate adjustment (CA). We apply DeepFEIVR and DeepFEIVR\\u2010CA to the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) individual\\u2010level data as training data for model building, then apply to the UK Biobank neuroimaging and the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) AD GWAS summary data, showcasing how the extracted causal features are related to AD and various brain endophenotypes.\",\n",

The aim was to enhance agricultural decision-making and management, especially in regions with limited water resources, where crop productivity and sustainability are crucial for achieving food security and sustainable development. To achieve this objective, this study utilized machine-learning classification algorithms in conjunction with Landsat and Sentinel satellite imagery. The classification of different crops was based on Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) phenology . The classification process and post-processing were conducted using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform , as well as utilizing Python, and scikit-learn library. Ground-truth data provided by local experts, along with the EUROMAP 2018 dataset in South Spain, were used to label the classification results . The findings of this study demonstrated a classification accuracy of 72% for certain crop types, indicating significant implications for sustainable agricultural practices and land use planning.\",\n",

Diverse strategies are needed, including the liberation of heritage data locked within specialist literature such as floras and taxonomic monographs. Here we report FloraTraiter, a novel approach using rule\\u2010based natural language processing (NLP) to parse computable trait data from biodiversity literature.FloraTraiter was implemented through collaborative work between programmers and botanical experts and customized for both online floras and scanned literature. We report a strategy spanning optical character recognition, recognition of taxa, iterative building of traits, and establishing linkages among all of these, as well as curational tools and code for turning these results into standard morphological matrices.Over 95% of treatment content was successfully parsed for traits with <1% error. Data for more than 700 taxa are reported, including a demonstration of common downstream uses.We identify strategies, applications, tips, and challenges that we hope will facilitate future similar efforts to produce large open\\u2010source trait data sets for broad community reuse. Largely automated tools like FloraTraiter will be an important addition to the toolkit for assembling trait data at scale.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The aim of this study was to design a new canine posture estimation system specifically for working dogs. The system was composed of Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) that are commercially available, and a supervised learning algorithm which was developed for different behaviours. Three IMUs, each containing a 3-axis accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer, were attached to the dogs\\u2019 chest, back, and neck. To build and test the model, data were collected during a video-recorded behaviour test where the trainee assistance dogs performed static postures (standing, sitting, lying down) and dynamic activities (walking, body shake). Advanced feature extraction techniques were employed for the first time in this field, including statistical, temporal, and spectral methods. The most important features for posture prediction were chosen using Select K Best with ANOVA F-value. The individual contributions of each IMU, sensor, and feature type were analysed using Select K Best scores and Random Forest feature importance. Results showed that the back and chest IMUs were more important than the neck IMU, and the accelerometers were more important than the gyroscopes. The addition of IMUs to the chest and back of dog harnesses is recommended to improve performance. Additionally, statistical and temporal feature domains were more important than spectral feature domains. Three novel cascade arrangements of Random Forest and Isolation Forest were fitted to the dataset. The best classifier achieved an f1-macro of 0.83 and an f1-weighted of 0.90 for the prediction of the five postures, demonstrating a better performance than previous studies. These results were attributed to the data collection methodology (number of subjects and observations, multiple IMUs, use of common working dog breeds) and novel machine learning techniques (advanced feature extraction, feature selection and modelling arrangements) employed. The dataset and code used are publicly available on Mendeley Data and GitHub, respectively.\",\n",

Drawing on ethnographic data of two telling cases, it explores how minoritized students\\u2019 subjectivities were linked to neoliberal discourses of English and constituted by power techniques, self\\u2010technologies, and affective dispositions embedded in wider institutional transformations. Participants were found experiencing a shift to the individualistic subjectivity associated with academic achievement and performance in English away from the collective identity of \\u201cauthentic Uyghur\\u201d symbolized by the Uyghur language. Two salient discourses of English, i.e., English as constraints, and English as academic excellence, emerging from the neoliberal\\u2010oriented institutional English language education policies and practices, shaped the participants either as incompetent English learners or elite subjects. Participants learned to responsibilitize themselves through such self\\u2010technologies as confession and preaching, and affective practices. Yet, technologies of hope and optimism became for a few the enjoyment of experiences and performance of elitism while projecting a majority disadvantaged as affectively problematic others. The self\\u2010technologies and affective responses without recognition of larger structures of inequality could further reinforce the neoliberal logic. The affective labor of sense of solidarity, commitment to community, empathy for the deprived ones with critical reflection and collective action, nevertheless, may counter neoliberal logic and point to an alternative path to meaning\\u2010making and social relations.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Simple Summary Accurately estimating body weight is crucial for managing water buffalo health and optimizing feeding strategies. This study explored the effectiveness of machine learning models in predicting body weight based on body measurements. Principal component analysis was employed to reduce the dimensionality of the data and identify the most relevant features. Subsequently, Gradient Boosting and Random Forest algorithms were utilized to predict body weight using the reduced data set. The Gradient Boosting algorithm demonstrated superior performance compared to the Random Forest algorithm. These findings suggest that the combination of principal component analysis and Gradient Boosting offers a reliable and effective method for estimating body weight in water buffaloes. This approach holds promise for improving animal production and health management practices. Future research could focus on enhancing the applicability and generalizability of these models to diverse water buffalo populations across various geographical regions. Abstract This study aims to use advanced machine learning techniques supported by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to estimate body weight (BW) in buffalos raised in southeastern Mexico and compare their performance. The first stage of the current study consists of body measurements and the process of determining the most informative variables using PCA, a dimension reduction method. This process reduces the data size by eliminating the complex structure of the model and provides a faster and more effective learning process. As a second stage, two separate prediction models were developed with Gradient Boosting and Random Forest algorithms, using the principal components obtained from the data set reduced by PCA. The performances of both models were compared using R2, RMSE and MAE metrics, and showed that the Gradient Boosting model achieved a better prediction performance with a higher R2 value and lower error rates than the Random Forest model. In conclusion, PCA-supported modeling applications can provide more reliable results, and the Gradient Boosting algorithm is superior to Random Forest in this context. The current study demonstrates the potential use of machine learning approaches in estimating body weight in water buffalos, and will support sustainable animal husbandry by contributing to decision making processes in the field of animal science.\",\n",

Findings In this cohort study, sound environments cataloged using machine learning for cochlear implants were measured by 2746 datalogs for 262 children using cochlear implants before and during 2 years of COVID-19 lockdowns in Ontario, Canada. Due to school closures during lockdowns, school-aged children experienced significantly decreased exposure to spoken language, which has not recovered to the prepandemic baseline. Meaning This study suggests that school closures due to COVID-19 lockdowns are associated with reduced exposure to spoken communications among children using cochlear implants during sensitive periods of development.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Introduction Intravesical onabotulinumA injection is actively used for the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB). However, it occasionally results in significant post-void residual urine (PVR) volume, which can lead to complications and can further impair the activities of daily living in older people. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the predictors of a high post-onabotulinumA injection PVR volume in older women with severe OAB. Methods An observational study was conducted on older women who had previously received intravesical onabotulinumA injections to treat OAB between 2020 and 2022. Urodynamic studies and symptom assessments were conducted, and machine learning models, including random forest and support vector machine (SVM) models, were developed using the R code generated by Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (ChatGPT, OpenAI, San Francisco, USA). Results Among 128 patients with OAB, 23 (18.0%) had a PVR volume of > 200 mL after receiving onabotulinumA injections. The factors associated with a PVR volume of > 200 mL were investigated using univariate and multivariate analyses. Age, frailty, OAB-wet, daytime frequency, and nocturia were significant predictors. Random forest analysis highlighted daytime frequency, frailty, and voiding efficiency as important factors. An SVM model incorporating daytime frequency, frailty, and voiding efficiency improved PVR volume prediction. Logit(p) estimation yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.926294. Conclusion The study found daytime frequency, frailty, and voiding inefficiency to be significant factors associated with a PVR volume of > 200 mL, in older women with severe OAB. Utilizing advanced machine learning techniques and following the guidance of ChatGPT, this research emphasizes the relevance of considering multiple intersecting factors for predicting PVR volume. The findings contribute to our understanding of onabotulinumA injection treatment for OAB and support evidence-based decision-making using readily available information.\",\n",

Its primary objective is to tarnish individuals' public reputations while profiting from advertisements built on false content. We introduce an efficient fake news detection system using binary classification, employing attention-based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models. Our unified model, characterized by superior accuracy and comprehension, undergoes rigorous evaluation with an internet-sourced dataset, consistently yielding top-tier performance metrics. Despite relying on a single model for the entire detection process, it maintains end-to-end optimization flexibility, minimizes errors, and effectively balances bias-variance trade-offs. Our study explores fake news articles, their creators, and detection challenges, identifying heterogeneous social network patterns, both overt and covert, frequently exploited by fake news creators. We introduce a Deep Diffusive Network Model incorporating network structural data into learning. Our straightforward, linear, low-latency system achieves 98% accuracy in fake news detection. In addition to modeling and detection, advanced data analysis techniques yield deeper dataset insights.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Nowadays, developing Wi-Fi-based indoor localization systems has become an attractive research topic due to the growing need for pervasive location determination. The fingerprint technique offers higher positioning accuracy in indoor localization than the distance-based technique. Fingerprint-based techniques via machine learning have been proposed for many years to provide high-accuracy indoor localization services. These works attempt to establish the optimal correlation between the user fingerprint and a pre-defined set of grid points on a radio map. In this paper, a comparative analysis of selected machine learning algorithms is conducted within the context of online phase fingerprint techniques for localization, focusing on implementation in a multi-room case. The experiment involves measurements using a Wi-Fi module in a laboratory, an aisle, a lobby, and a typical classroom, resulting in a small-sized fingerprint database covering a total area of 573.71 m2. The results reveal that Na\\u00efve Bayes (NB) obtains the highest localization accuracy in the laboratory and classroom. Meanwhile, Support Vector Machine (SVM) outperforms other algorithms in the aisle, while K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) delivers the best accuracy in the lobby. In summary, NB, KNN, and SVM are suitable pattern-matching algorithms for multi-room indoor localization and relatively small fingerprint databases.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Pruning of neural networks is undoubtedly a popular approach to cope with the current compression of large-scale, high-cost network models. However, most of the existing methods require a high level of human-regulated pruning criteria, which requires a lot of human effort to figure out a reasonable pruning strength. One of the main reasons is that there are different levels of sensitivity distribution in the network. Our main goal is to discover compression methods that adapt to this distribution to avoid deep architectural damage to the network due to unnecessary pruning. In this paper, we propose a filter texture distribution that affects the training of the network. We also analyze the sensitivity of each of the diverse states of this distribution. To do so, we first use a multidimensional penalty method that can analyze the potential sensitivity based on this texture distribution to obtain a pruning-friendly sparse environment. Then, we set up a lightweight dynamic threshold container in order to prune the sparse network. By providing each filter with a suitable threshold for that filter at a low cost, a massive reduction in the number of parameters is achieved without affecting the contribution of certain pruning-sensitive layers to the network as a whole. In the final experiments, our two methods adapted to texture distribution were applied to ResNet Deep Neural Network (DNN) and VGG-16, which were deployed on the classical CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet datasets with excellent results in order to facilitate comparison with good cutting-edge pruning methods.

      "      \"abstract\": \"\\n Introduction:\\n In many cases, treatment decisions for multiple myeloma patients must be made in the absence of high quality randomized controlled clinical trials. As a result, many clinicians lean on prognostic models to drive treatment selection. The most widely used of these models incorporate a limited number of patient related factors that reflect tumor burden, cytogenetic features, or gene expression profiling. These prediction scores are derived from regression models that incorporate these variables at the time of diagnosis. They do not account for variables that change dynamically over time, do not explore the relationship between treatment selection and progression, and imperfectly predict survival outcomes. We designed a prognostic model based on an ensemble machine learning platform to predict progression in NDMM using Extreme Gradient Boosting Machine (XGBoost) combined with accelerated failure time modeling for survival analysis.\\n Methods:\\n We utilized a large retrospective data set containing treatment and response information for 1127 patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) treated at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation between 2000 and 2023. Following data preprocessing based on data completeness, 953 patient records were included in our training, testing, and cross validation datasets. For the purposes of our analysis, the initial dataset was randomly split into training (70%), testing (15%) and validation (15%) subsets at the patient level. We also defined the lower and upper bounds for each subset, which is critical due to the right-censored nature of survival data. Hyperparameters for XGBoost were optimized using Bayesian search, minimizing the negative log-likelihood. A random forest method was applied for the imputation of missing data (MissForest). We then trained the XGBoost model using GPU acceleration for enhanced computational efficiency. Finally, a log-rank test on predicted survival times was used to test the model's performance on patients with and without known progression.\\n Results:\\n Our preprocessed data set had 953 patients with a mean age at disease onset of 65 years and a slight male predominance (55%). Approximately 27% of patients harbored high cytogenetic risk disease and 3.5% of the cohort presented with extramedullary disease a diagnosis. At a median follow up of 35 months, 47% of patients had experienced disease progression or death. Induction therapy included an immunomodulatory drug in 40% of patients and proteasome inhibitors in 22%. Frontline autologous stem cell transplantation followed induction in 28% of patients. Median progression free survival in the overall data set was 44 months. These features were consistent across the randomly assigned training, testing, and validation cohorts.\\n Following data preprocessing, 34 independent clinical and genomic variables including selection of first line treatment were assessed as model inputs each available record. Under optimized parameters, the model was trained with a maximum tree depth = 7 and a learning rate ~ 0.22 for the desired output of progression free survival (PFS). We then queried PFS for both the training and validation sets and divided patients into those known to have progressed and those without a progression event. Survival analysis was undertaken using predicted PFS values for patients known to have progressed and those who remained progression free. For the validation data set, our model successfully discerned between progressed and non-progressed cases (log-rank test statistic = 22.07, p < 0.005) (Figure 1).\\n Discussion:\\n We present a machine learning approach based on regularized gradient boosting that accurately discerns between patients who experience progression and those who remain progression free at a median ~35 months of follow-up in a large retrospective data set in patients presenting with NDMM. Further elaboration of our model will allow for the incorporation of large amounts data to predict survival outcomes on the basis of dynamic variables such as depth of response and treatment selection. With the ability to parse outcomes among multiple myeloma patients at high resolution, future clinicians and clinical trialists may be able to overcome limitations in trial design and patient-level therapy selection for both newly diagnosed and relapsed patients.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Using technology for sentiment analysis in the travel industry can extract valuable insights from customer reviews. It can assist businesses in gaining a deeper understanding of their consumers\\u2019 emotional tendencies and enhance their services\\u2019 caliber. However, travel-related online reviews are rife with colloquialisms, sparse feature dimensions, metaphors, and sarcasm. As a result, traditional semantic representations of word vectors are inaccurate, and single neural network models do not take into account multiple associative features. To address the above issues, we introduce a dual-channel algorithm that integrates convolutional neural networks (CNN) and bi-directional long and short-term memory (BiLSTM) with an attention mechanism (DC-CBLA). First, the model utilizes the pre-trained BERT, a transformer-based model, to extract a dynamic vector representation for each word that corresponds to the current contextual representation. This process enhances the accuracy of the vector semantic representation. Then, BiLSTM is used to capture the global contextual sequence features of the travel text, while CNN is used to capture the richer local semantic information. A hybrid feature network combining CNN and BiLSTM can improve the model\\u2019s representation ability. Additionally, the BiLSTM output is feature-weighted using the attention mechanism to enhance the learning of its fundamental features and lessen the influence of noise features on the outcomes. Finally, the Softmax function is used to classify the dual-channel fused features. We conducted an experimental evaluation of two data sets: tourist attractions and tourist hotels. The accuracy of the DC-CBLA model is 95.23% and 89.46%, and that of the F1-score is 97.05% and 93.86%, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed DC-CBLA model outperforms other baseline models.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Green VANET is an emerging field of research that spurs interest in energy consumption management for the development of smart cities. It also presents a unique variety of research problems for developing trustworthy and scalable routing protocols as vehicles are susceptible to the restrictions of road geometry and the barriers which limit networking capabilities in urban environments. Clustering is a process of assembling vehicle nodes to create a powerful and effective network infrastructure. According to recent studies, clustering-based routing algorithms in green VANET may significantly improve networking effectiveness and lower infrastructure costs. However, sometimes the vehicle nodes are unaware of their OBU energy consumption, which causes network execution issues and topological alterations. In such instances, the energy consumption of onboard sensors becomes a major problem in the clustering-based routing protocol. Hence, this paper proposes a self-organizing map neural network (SOMNN) based dynamic clustering model to identify energy-efficient nodes from each cluster for vehicular data uploading and downloading applications. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model solves network lifetime issues and provides superior network effectiveness with enhanced communication stability. \\u00a0The suggested dynamic clustering model reduces network energy consumption by 26% and 18% in comparison to k \\u2013 means (KM) and fuzzy c \\u2013 means (FCM) based clustering model.\",\n",

Though poor sustainment can lead to negative consequences for clinical teams, organizations\\u00a0and patients, the causal explanations of sustainment are largely unknown.\\n\\n\\nAIMS AND OBJECTIVES\\nWe aimed to ascertain how (mechanisms) and in what circumstances (context) a newly implemented outcome measure in rehabilitation was sustained or not (outcome).\\n\\n\\nMETHODOLOGY\\nInformed by an integrated knowledge translation approach, we conducted a realist evaluation using a mixed method, embedded single case study design with data collection up to 18 months following the implementation of the Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory - version 4 (MPAI-4), a rehabilitation outcome measure. Quantitative data (survey and patient charts) was analysed using descriptive statistics, then integrated with qualitative data (interviews with 10 key informants) and analysed using inductive and deductive retroduction. We integrated the data to develop a case description and ultimately, to refine the programme theory to better understand the sustainability of the MPAI-4.\\n\\n\\nRESULTS\\nWe linked context, mechanisms\\u00a0and outcomes, and also emphasized sustainability strategies in 18 explanations of how sustainability works. These explanations provide evidence for four overarching patterns: (1) implementation and sustainability phases are interconnected, (2) outcomes build on each other recursively, with patient benefits as the keystone outcome, (3) sustainment is achieved to varying levels across different sustainability outcomes [e.g., high level (e.g., rate of MPAI-4 scoring: 77.7%) to low level (e.g., rate of MPAI-4 application to clinical decision-making: 3.7%)] and (4) the work of sustaining the MPAI-4 is shared amongst different stakeholders.\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\nImplementation teams can draw from this programme theory to improve the sustainment of outcomes measures while researchers could continue to refine the theory. Continued investigation of sustainability, including diverse and continuous sustainability outcomes, is needed to understand how to maintain improvements in quality of care and patient outcomes.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Machine learning algorithms present substantial promise for more effective decision\\u2010making by administrative agencies. However, some of these algorithms are inscrutable, namely, they produce predictions that humans cannot understand or explain. This trait is in tension with the emphasis on reason\\u2010giving in administrative law. The article explores this tension, advancing two interrelated arguments. First, providing adequate reasons is a significant facet of respecting individuals\\u2019 agency. Incorporating inscrutable algorithmic predictions into administrative decision\\u2010making compromises this normative ideal. Second, as a long\\u2010term concern, the use of inscrutable algorithms by administrative agencies may generate systemic effects by gradually reducing the realm of the humanly explainable in public life, a phenomenon Max Weber termed \\u2018re\\u2010enchantment\\u2019. As a result, the use of inscrutable machine learning algorithms might trigger a special kind of re\\u2010enchantment, making us comprehend less rather than more of shared human experience, and consequently altering the way we understand the administrative state and experience public life.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"\\n Introduction:\\n The utility of ECG to diagnose left ventricular (LV) dilation in patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB) is not known. We sought to compare the diagnostic yield of ECG using (i) QRS duration, (ii) published LVH criteria, and (iii) machine learning (ML) models to detect increased left ventricular end diastolic volume indexed (LVEDVi) in the setting of LBBB.\\n \\n \\n Hypothesis:\\n ML is superior to QRS duration and LVH criteria to detect increased LVEDVi among LBBB.\\n \\n \\n Methods:\\n 12-lead ECGs were processed to reconstruct orthogonal X, Y, Z leads using Kors\\u2019s matrix and obtain root-mean-squared (3D) ECG. R wave, S wave and overall amplitudes, voltage-time-integrals (VTIs), and other ECG features were extracted from all ECG leads. ML algorithms [logistic regression (LR), support vector classifier (SVC), decision trees (DT), random forest (RF), gradient boosted machine (GBM) and boosted trees (BT)] were trained to predict increased LVEDVi (women >61 mL/m\\n 2\\n , men >74 mL/m\\n 2\\n ) from ECG features on a training set of 2668 ECGs with typical LBBB and echocardiogram within 45 days before or after ECG. LVEDV was measured using ASE biplane method of discs. We obtained ROC AUCs for prediction of increased LVEDVi by (i) QRS duration, (ii) published LVH criteria, and (iii) ML models in a separate validation set of adults with typical LBBB.\\n \\n \\n Results:\\n Among the validation set of 413 adults (53% women, age 73\\u00b112 yr) with LBBB, QRS duration alone had a higher AUC (women 0.668, men 0.699) for diagnosing increased LVMi compared to standard LVH criteria (Table). The best ML model (RF with overall AUC 0.694) did not substantially outperform QRS duration alone.\\n \\n \\n Conclusions:\\n In patients with LBBB, QRS duration \\u2265150 in women and \\u2265160 in men is a superior predictor of LV dilation than traditional ECG-based LVH criteria, with no additional value added by ML methods.\\n \\n \\n \\n\",\n",

However, not everyone understands how these technologies work. There are many misconceptions surrounding what they can and cannot do, and what are the risks and benefits. Thus, there is a need to educate the general public about everyday AI, upscaling their algorithmic literacy and helping them become more informed, responsible users. We describe the development and evaluation of an eight-week course open to the public, AI in Everyday Life. Pre- and post-course questionnaires were used to evaluate the impact of the course and participants' attitudes towards AI applications. The results suggest that more targeted educational approaches are needed for the general public to fully understand the strengths and weaknesses of the use of AI-enabled technologies.\",\n",

Due to the increase in motors, the number of power lines and position sensor cable wiring are increased; this increase in complicated wiring is a problem. As a method to solve these problems, power superimposition technology in the power line of a PMSM is expected to reduce the distribution cables. In this paper, the power superposition technology method, and circuit equations of mounting transformers in power lines are presented and are then verified by experiment, simulation, and linear analysis. The circuit equation is proposed as a three\\u2010phase circuit equation, which is transformed into a dq\\u2010circuit equation by a transformation matrix. The characteristics of the electric angular frequency versus the dq\\u2010axis voltage demonstrated satisfactory results, with errors within 1% in linear analysis and simulation. The linear analysis and experiment are shown to be similar, although there are some errors. The validity of the circuit equations could be demonstrated by the verification results.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Abstract Aims This study aimed to investigate key regulators of aberrant iron metabolism in gliomas, and evaluate their effect on biological functions and clinical translational relevance. Methods We used transcriptomic data from multiple cross\\u2010platform glioma cohorts to identify key iron metabolism\\u2010related genes (IMRGs) based on a series of bioinformatic and machine learning methods. The associations between IMRGs and prognosis, mesenchymal phenotype, and genomic alterations were analyzed in silico. The performance of the IMRGs\\u2010based signature in predicting temozolomide (TMZ) treatment sensitivity was evaluated. In vitro and in vivo experiments were used to explore the biological functions of these key IMRGs. Results HMOX1, LTF, and STEAP3 were identified as the most essential IMRGs in gliomas. The expression levels of these genes were strongly related to clinicopathological and molecular features. The robust IMRG\\u2010based gene signature could be used for prognosis prediction. These genes facilitate mesenchymal transformation, driver gene mutations, and oncogenic alterations in gliomas. The gene signature was also associated with TMZ resistance. HMOX1, LTF, and STEAP3 knockdown in glioma cells significantly reduced cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, and malignant invasion. Conclusion The study presented a comprehensive view of key regulators underpinning iron metabolism in gliomas and provided new insights into novel therapeutic approaches.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Supervised deep learning is widely used in the field of rain and haze weather removal currently and has achieved excellent results. However, it is challenging to learn the potential relationship between rain and haze image input and clean image output in learning based network training because it is extremely difficult to obtain the matched Noising-Clean image data pairs in the real world for supervised learning model train. To overcome this obstacle, in this paper, we propose a high-order rain and haze degradation process to generate a large number of more realistic and complex rain haze image training pairs, and build an end-to-end unified model G3RHW for rain haze generation and removal based on generative adversarial networks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves more superior image detail recovery and the removal of the effect of rain and haze results on both synthetic and realistic dataset than state-of-the-art methods fine-tuned for adverse weather removal.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Multi-spectral object Re-identification (ReID) aims to retrieve specific objects by leveraging complementary information from different image spectra. It delivers great advantages over traditional single-spectral ReID in complex visual environment. However, the significant distribution gap among different image spectra poses great challenges for effective multi-spectral feature representations. In addition, most of current Transformer-based ReID methods only utilize the global feature of class tokens to achieve the holistic retrieval, ignoring the local discriminative ones. To address the above issues, we step further to utilize all the tokens of Transformers and propose a cyclic token permutation framework for multi-spectral object ReID, dubbled TOP-ReID. More specifically, we first deploy a multi-stream deep network based on vision Transformers to preserve distinct information from different image spectra. Then, we propose a Token Permutation Module (TPM) for cyclic multi-spectral feature aggregation. It not only facilitates the spatial feature alignment across different image spectra, but also allows the class token of each spectrum to perceive the local details of other spectra. Meanwhile, we propose a Complementary Reconstruction Module (CRM), which introduces dense token-level reconstruction constraints to reduce the distribution gap across different image spectra. With the above modules, our proposed framework can generate more discriminative multi-spectral features for robust object ReID. Extensive experiments on three ReID benchmarks (i.e., RGBNT201, RGBNT100 and MSVR310) verify the effectiveness of our methods. The code is available at https://github.com/924973292/TOP-ReID.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The research relevance is determined by the need to review the regulatory aspects of the digitalisation of civil litigation in the Kyrgyz Republic, given the complex set of problems that exist in this area. The main objective of the study is to analyse the digital civil litigation in China with the prospect of extracting positive experience for possible implementation in Kyrgyzstan. The methods of statistical analysis, analogy, generalisation, as well as formal-legal and formal-logical approaches are used in the study. As a result of the analysis of the peculiarities of legal regulation of online civil proceedings in China, modern mechanisms of this regulation are found to contribute to maintaining stability and improving the efficiency of the judicial system. The scientific research confirms the fundamental concept that the integration of information technologies into the processes of legal proceedings does not affect the fundamental concepts of the theory of judicial evidence. Nevertheless, the analysis also identified significant risks associated with this process, such as an increase in the number of court cases, potential distortion of the nature of judicial activity, and other aspects. This study provides a conceptual approach to facilitating access to justice through the digital transformation of court procedures. This approach includes the use of information and telecommunication technologies and remote alternative dispute resolution methods such as online mediation and online dispute resolution systems. Special attention is paid to the need to consider the interests of all parties when introducing artificial intelligence into the judicial system. The study of different points of view allows for a deeper understanding of the complexity of this process and identifies possible ways to improve civil litigation in the context of digitalisation in Kyrgyzstan. The findings of the study are of potential value for the implementation of China's positive experience in the context of the digitalisation of civil litigation in Kyrgyzstan.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"This study aims to comprehend linguistic and socio-demographic features, encompassing English language styles, conveyed sentiments, and lexical diversity within spatial online social media review data. To this end, we undertake a case study that scrutinizes reviews composed by two distinct and demographically diverse groups. Our analysis entails the extraction and examination of various statistical, grammatical, and sentimental features from these two groups. Subsequently, we leverage these features with machine learning (ML) classifiers to discern their potential in effectively differentiating between the groups. Our investigation unveils substantial disparities in certain linguistic attributes between the two groups. When integrated into ML classifiers, these attributes exhibit a marked efficacy in distinguishing the groups, yielding a macro F1 score of approximately 0.85. Furthermore, we conduct a comparative evaluation of these linguistic features with word n-gram-based lexical features in discerning demographically diverse review data. As expected, the n-gram lexical features, coupled with fine-tuned transformer-based models, show superior performance, attaining accuracies surpassing 95\\\\% and macro F1 scores exceeding 0.96. Our meticulous analysis and comprehensive evaluations substantiate the efficacy of linguistic and sentimental features in effectively discerning demographically diverse review data. The findings of this study provide valuable guidelines for future research endeavors concerning the analysis of demographic patterns in textual content across various social media platforms.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"\\n With the development of electric vehicles, the demand for lithium-ion batteries has been increasing annually. Accurately estimating the State of Health (SOH) of lithium-ion batteries is crucial for their efficient and reliable use. Most of the existing research on SOH estimation is based on parameters such as current, voltage, and temperature, which are prone to fluctuations. Estimating the SOH of lithium-ion batteries based on Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) and data-driven approaches has been proven effective. In this paper, we explore a novel SOH estimation model for lithium batteries based on EIS and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-Vision Transformer (VIT). The EIS data is treated as a grayscale image, eliminating the need for manual feature extraction and simultaneously capturing both local and global features in the data. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, a series of simulation experiments are conducted, comparing it with various traditional machine learning models in terms of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Coefficient of Determination (R2). The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model performs best overall in the testing dataset at three different temperatures. This confirms that the model can accurately and stably estimate the SOH of lithium-ion batteries without requiring manual feature extraction and knowledge of battery aging temperature.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"As an effective approach for Vision Transformers (ViT) to obtain better initializations and representations in natural image analysis, Masked image modeling (MIM), performs the pretext task of reconstructing images by adopting partial observations without any label. Several works adopted dissimilar mask strategies to make ViT aggregate contextual information to infer missed contents. Nonetheless, chest radiographs conspicuously differ from photographic images, and conducting MIM in chest X-rays remains challenging. On that account, this paper came up with a specialized pre-training recipe cxrMIM and a masking strategy for chest radiographs on the basis of their physiological characters. In cxrMIM, the out-of-lung region was first analyzed, and the lung region was then reconstructed with the help of mechanical connections and similarities of anatomy and physiology. cxrMIM facilitates ViT to excavate the commonalities of pulmonary structures and promote better performance on downstream tasks. We conducted experiments on the ChestX-ray 14 dataset using advanced self-supervised methods (e.g. MoCo v3, MAE) for comparison. Quantitative and qualitative results signified that cxrMIM reinforced the efficiency of Vision Transformer to resolve the multi-label thorax disease classification problem, and cxrMIM pretrained Swin-B performed comparably to the state-of-the-art CNN models.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Objectives This study aims to assess the short-term outcome of total hip arthroplasty for treating developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) using artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted three-dimensional (3D) preoperative planning technology. Patients and methods Between January 2020 and July 2022, a total of 61 patients with DDH (31 males, 30 females, mean age: 59.2\\u00b110.4 years; range, 35 to 78 years) were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided into two groups as those in the observation group of AI-assisted 3D preoperative planning technology (n=34) and the control group of traditional two-dimensional X-ray template planning technology (n=27). Perioperative data of the patients were recorded and analyzed. Results All patients were followed for more than one year, and no hip dislocation, aseptic loosening, periprosthetic fracture, periprosthetic infection or revision occurred. The accuracy of the planning was based on the agreement between the preoperative planning model and the intraoperative model. The accuracy of preoperative planning for the acetabular prosthesis and femoral prosthesis in the observation group was significantly higher than in the control group. No statistically significant difference was found in the postoperative abduction (p=0.416) and anteversion (p=0.225) between the groups. In the observation group, 91.2% of the acetabular cups were implanted within the Lewinnek safe zone (66.7% in the control group) and 88.2% were within the Callanan safe zone (63% in the control group). There was a statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of the postoperative lower-limb length discrepancy (p=0.004), which was significantly improved in both groups compared to preoperative values (p<0.01 for all). The postoperative Harris hip score in both groups was significantly improved compared to preoperative scores (p<0.01); however, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups (p=0.098). Conclusion Our study results suggest that AI-assisted 3D preoperative planning is evidently more successful than traditional 2D X-ray template planning for predicting prosthesis size. This method seems to be advantageous in acetabular cup positioning, as well as in lower-limb length restoration.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"N4-methylcytosine (4mC) is a common DNA methylation that has been implicated in epigenetic regulation and host defense. Accurate prediction of 4mC sites in DNA sequences will help to better explore the biological processes and mechanisms. For this problem, computational methods based on machine learning and deep learning are faster, less complex, and less expensive than experimental detection methods. However, the existing computational methods are still unsatisfactory in terms of prediction accuracy, so we propose a new method with better performance. In this work, we propose a weighted fuzzy system for identifying DNA 4mC sites by kernel entropy component analysis (KECA). We named it as W-TSK-FS-KECA. This model is improved based on the Takagi\\u2013Sugeuo\\u2013Kang fuzzy system (TSK-FS). We use position-specific trinucleotide propensity to construct feature vectors on representative benchmark datasets. Then we use KECA to get the reconstruct error. Finally, we put the calculated reconstruction error add to the regular term of TSK-FS as the weights to enhance the model performance. Comparative experiments with other methods show that it has good classification perfor- mance.\",\n",

Some public facilities cannot survive due to human indifference and irresponsible actions. Unfortunately, the government has to spend a lot of money, effort, and time to repair the damage. One of the destructive behaviors that can have an impact on infrastructure and environmental problems is littering. Therefore, this paper proposes a device as an alternative for catching littering rule violators. The proposed device can be used to monitor littering and provide warnings to help officers responsible for capturing the violators. In this innovation, the data obtained by the camera are sent to a mini-PC. The device will send warning information to a mobile phone when someone litters. Then, a speaker will turn on and issue a sound warning: \\u201cDo not litter\\u201d. The device uses pose detection and a recurrent neural network (RNN) to recognize a person\\u2019s activity.

To ensure smooth and safe ski-jump takeoff testing, this paper first determines the influencing factors of ski-jump takeoff based on the dynamics model. Secondly, based on the BP neural network, the corresponding relationship between the influencing factors, the angle of attack and the lifting speed is established.

In order to grasp the current research status, hotspots, and frontiers in the field of ionic liquids in flame retardancy, the bibliometric mapping method is applied to study the relevant literature in Web of Science datasets from 2000\\u20132022 in this paper. The results show that the research on ionic liquids in flame retardancy is multidisciplinary and involves some disciplines such as energy science, material science, and environmental protection. Journal of Power Sources, Polymer Degradation and Stability, ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces, and Chemical Engineering Journal are the core journals in the field. The results of keyword co-occurrence indicate that the hotspots of research can be divided into five components: the improvement and application of pure ionic liquids electrolytes, the research of gel polymer electrolytes, applying ionic liquids to enhance the polymer materials\\u2019 flame retardancy properties, utilizing ionic liquids and inorganic materials to synergize flame retardant polymers, and using ionic liquids flame retardant to improve material\\u2019s multiple properties. The burst terms and time zone diagram\\u2019s results point out the combination of computational quantum chemistry to study the flame retardancy mechanism of ionic liquids, the study of fluorinated electrolytes, ionic liquids for smoke suppression, phosphorus-containing ionic liquids for flame retardant, and machine learning-assisted design of ILs flame retardants are the research frontiers and future research trends.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"To ensure that accuracy and latency are not compromised while deploying Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on edge devices, trained DNN models can be partitioned across many collaborating edge devices for inference. However, this collaborative inference paradigm raises new security risks because one of the collaborating edge devices could be malicious or compromised, leading to compromised accuracy and reliability of inference results. To address this challenge, this paper explores the use of low-pass filters to enhance the robustness of Collaborative DNNs. The study deploys a VGG16 network, trained on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmarks (GTSRB) dataset, and a MobileNet network trained on the ImageNet dataset, using two prevalent collaborative inference methodologies. The output feature maps (FMs) of a vulnerable edge device are perturbed using four advanced adversarial noises, namely Speckle, Salt-and-Pepper, Gaussian noise, and the Fast Gradient Signed Method (FGSM). Experimental results demonstrate that implementing low-pass filtering can significantly enhance the robustness of Collaborative DNNs. On average, the top-1 classification accuracy is improved by 2.1x times, making the DNNs more robust to adversarial attacks.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Deep learning methods have been applied for dynamic brain functional network analysis recently. However, they are usually restricted by the complex spatio-temporal dynamics and the limited labeled data. In this paper, we proposed a stacked Transformer neural network, namely BrainPST, to capture spatio-temporal patterns for dynamic brain functional network classification. BrainPST model integrated spatial and temporal information by stacking two Transformers: one for learning snapshot networks and the other for learning sequence of functional connections. Unlike recent models, BrainPST was designed to pre-train the stacked Transformer network by leveraging unlabeled existing brain imaging data. A pre-training framework with designed pre-training strategies was proposed to learn general spatio-temporal representations from the unlabeled brain networks, and to fine-tune the pre-trained model in downstream tasks. BrainPST is a conceptually simple and effective model. The results of experiments showed the BrainPST model without pre-training achieved comparative performance with the recent models, and the pre-trained BrainPST obtained new state-of-the-art performance. The pre-trained BrainPST improved 3.92% of AUC compared with the model without pre-training.\",\n",

Traditional approaches such as sliding window and feature extraction have limitations in accurately detecting vehicles in aerial images. Deep learning models like R-CNN, Faster R-CNN, & Mask R-CNN were proposed & demonstrated exceptional performance. However, there remain challenges in their direct application to vehicle detection in aerial images. Modifications were proposed to overcome these challenges, including improvements to region projected network & classifier and the use of instance segmentation in addition to object detection using bounding boxes. The article highlights the need for large aerial picture real-time detection and the importance of accurate vehicle recognition from aerial photographs in various applications, including urban planning and traffic management.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Background and purpose: Mandibular osteoradionecrosis (ORN) is a severe side effect affecting patients undergoing radiation therapy for head and neck cancer. Variations in the bone's vascularization and composition across the mandible may influence the susceptibility to ORN. Recently, deep learning-based models have been introduced for predicting mandibular ORN using radiation dose distribution maps to incorporate spatial information. These studies, however, only feature internal validation on a holdout subset of the data used for training. Methods and materials: This study externally validated a 3D DenseNet-40 (DN40) ORN prediction model on an independent dataset. Model performance was evaluated in terms of discrimination and calibration, with Platt scaling applied for improved external calibration. The DN40 model's discriminative ability on the external dataset was compared to a Random Forest model on corresponding dose-volume histogram (DVH) data. Results: The overall model performance was worse at external validation than at internal validation, with Platt scaling improving balance between recall and specificity but not significantly improving the overall calibration. Although the discrimination ability of the DN40 model was slightly lower at external validation (AUROC 0.63 vs. 0.69), this was statistically comparable to that of a DVH-based RF model for the same dataset (p-value 0.667). Conclusion: Our results suggest that, in addition to potential model overfitting issues, dosimetric data distribution differences between the two datasets could explain the low generalisability of the DN40 ORN prediction model. Future work will involve a larger and more diverse cohort.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Cameras and LiDARs are both important sensors for autonomous driving, playing critical roles for 3D object detection. Camera-LiDAR Fusion has been a prevalent solution for robust and accurate autonomous driving perception. In contrast to the vast majority of existing arts that focus on how to improve the performance of 3D target detection through cross-modal schemes, deep learning algorithms, and training tricks, we devote attention to the impact of sensor configurations on the performance of learning-based methods. To achieve this, we propose a unified information-theoretic surrogate metric for camera and LiDAR evaluation based on the proposed sensor perception model. We also design an accelerated high-quality framework for data acquisition, model training, and performance evaluation that functions with the CARLA simulator. To show the correlation between detection performance and our surrogate metrics, We conduct experiments using several camera-LiDAR placements and parameters inspired by self-driving companies and research institutions. Extensive experimental results of representative algorithms on NuScenes dataset validate the effectiveness of our surrogate metric, demonstrating that sensor configurations significantly impact point-cloud-image fusion based detection models, which contribute up to 30% discrepancy in terms of average precision.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Multiscale modeling of complex systems is crucial for understanding their intricacies. Data-driven multiscale modeling has emerged as a promising approach to tackle challenges associated with complex systems. On the other hand, self-similarity is prevalent in complex systems, hinting that large-scale complex systems can be modeled at a reduced cost. In this paper, we introduce a multiscale neural network framework that incorporates self-similarity as prior knowledge, facilitating the modeling of self-similar dynamical systems. For deterministic dynamics, our framework can discern whether the dynamics are self-similar. For uncertain dynamics, it can compare and determine which parameter set is closer to self-similarity. The framework allows us to extract scale-invariant kernels from the dynamics for modeling at any scale. Moreover, our method can identify the power law exponents in self-similar systems. Preliminary tests on the Ising model yielded critical exponents consistent with theoretical expectations, providing valuable insights for addressing critical phase transitions in non-equilibrium systems.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Typical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used to recognize a user's stress state using the functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), which is the latest brain imaging technology. fNIRS signals are usually fed into CNN models in the form of high-dimensional image data. However, this approach is not easy to achieve high classification accuracy because of physiological noises in brain signals. It is also likely to overlook the process of evaluating the reliability of calculated classification accuracy. To solve these problems, we proposed a memristor-based CNN (M-CNNs) This model's weight update process involves using stochastic gradient descent with momentum (SGDM), where the normalized conductances of memristors are used as weight substitutes. These conductances are then adjusted to classify stress states. We calculated the classification accuracies between the control and stress groups by using the M-CNNs, and then compared them with those of the CNNs. We used DenseNet, the most recent CNN model, to simulate accuracy under the same conditions. To ensure a fair comparison, we divided the DenseNet into the memristor-based DenseNet (M-DenseNet) and the conventional DenseNet (C-DenseNet). As a result, we discovered that the accuracy of M-CNNs (93.33%) exceeded that of CNNs (87.50%), and is reliable by precision, recall, and F-Score calculated from a confusion matrix. Likewise, M-DenseNet (92.38%) has higher accuracy than C-DenseNet (90.00%), but shows lower accuracy than M-CNNs. Moreover, we observed the reproducibility of M-CNN/DenseNet in various datasets. Therefore, our study suggests a promising application of CNN by combining conductances of memristor for classifying stress states.\",\n",

However, the quality of DIHM reconstructions is compromised by twin-image noise, posing a significant challenge. Conventional methods for mitigating this noise involve complex hardware setups or time-consuming algorithms with often limited effectiveness. In this work, we propose UTIRnet, a deep learning solution for fast, robust, and universally applicable twin-image suppression, trained exclusively on numerically generated datasets. The availability of open-source UTIRnet codes facilitates its implementation in various DIHM systems without the need for extensive experimental training data. Notably, our network ensures the consistency of reconstruction results with input holograms, imparting a physics-based foundation and enhancing reliability compared to conventional deep learning approaches. Experimental verification was conducted among others on live neural glial cell culture migration sensing, which is crucial for neurodegenerative disease research.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Large Language Models (LLM) and foundation models are popular as they offer new opportunities for individuals and businesses to improve natural language processing, interact with data, and retrieve information faster. However, training or fine-tuning LLMs requires a vast amount of data, which can be challenging to access due to legal or technical restrictions and may require private computing resources. Federated Learning (FL) is a solution designed to overcome these challenges and expand data access for deep learning applications. This paper takes a hardware-centric approach to explore how LLMs can be brought to modern edge computing systems. Our study fine-tunes the FLAN-T5 model family, ranging from 80M to 3B parameters, using FL for a text summarization task. We provide a micro-level hardware benchmark, compare the model FLOP utilization to a state-of-the-art data center GPU, and study the network utilization in realistic conditions. Our contribution is twofold: First, we evaluate the current capabilities of edge computing systems and their potential for LLM FL workloads. Second, by comparing these systems with a data-center GPU, we demonstrate the potential for improvement and the next steps toward achieving greater computational efficiency at the edge.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Despite its growth as a clinical activity and research topic, the complex dynamic nature of advance care planning (ACP) has posed serious challenges for researchers hoping to quantitatively measure it. Methods for measurement have traditionally depended on lengthy manual chart abstractions or static documents (e.g., advance directive forms) even though completion of such documents is only one aspect of ACP. Natural language processing (NLP), in the form of an assisted electronic health record (EHR) review, is a technological advancement that may help researchers better measure ACP activity. In this article, we aim to show how NLP-assisted EHR review supports more accurate and robust measurement of ACP. We do so by presenting three example applications that illustrate how using NLP for this purpose supports (1) measurement in research, (2) detailed insights into ACP in quality improvement, and (3) identification of current limitations of ACP in clinical settings.\",\n",

Although there are differences between insomnia and SD, they have similar symptoms and the same animal model. Currently, there is a lack of microarray data on insomnia. Therefore, for now, we are going to apply the SD data to insomnia. Although many studies have explained the possible mechanisms associated with insomnia, no previous studies have considered the key genes associated with insomnia or the relationship between insomnia and immune cells. In this study, we analyzed the relationship between key genes and immune cells by identifying biomarkers for the diagnosis of insomnia. Next, we verified the efficacy of these biomarkers experimentally. Methods First, we downloaded four microarrays (GSE11755, GSE12624, GSE28750, and GSE48080) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, which included data from 239 normal human blood samples and 365 blood specimens from patients with SD. Then, we analyzed two groups of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and used Support Vector Machine Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) analysis and the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression model to investigate these key genes. Next, we used CIBERSORT to investigate the composition of 22 immune cell components of key genes in SD patients. Finally, the expression levels of key biomarkers in sleep-deprived patients were examined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Results A total of 50 DEGs were identified: six genes were significantly upregulated, and 44 genes were significantly downregulated. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis showed that Salmonella infection, NOD-like receptor (NLR) signaling pathway, Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus infection, and Th17 cell differentiation were significant. Based on machine learning, we identified C2CD2L, SPINT2, APOL3, PKNOX1, and A2M as key genes for SD; these were confirmed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Immune cell infiltration analysis showed that C2CD2L, SPINT2, APOL3, PKNOX1, and A2M were related in different degrees to regulatory T cells (Tregs), follicular T helper cells, CD8 cells, and other immune cells. The qRT-PCR experiments confirmed that the expression levels of C2CD2L concurred with the results derived from machine learning, but PKNOX1 and APOL3 did not. Discussion In summary, we identified a key gene (C2CD2L) that may facilitate the development of biomarkers for insomnia.\",\n",

      "      \"title\": \"Predicting Survival Time of Ball Bearings in the Presence of Censoring\",\n",
      "      \"abstract\": \"Ball bearings find widespread use in various manufacturing and mechanical domains, and methods based on machine learning have been widely adopted in the field to monitor wear and spot defects before they lead to failures. Few studies, however, have addressed the problem of censored data, in which failure is not observed. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to predict the time to failure in ball bearings using survival analysis. First, we analyze bearing data in the frequency domain and annotate when a bearing fails by comparing the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the standard deviation between its break-in frequency bins and its break-out frequency bins. Second, we train several survival models to estimate the time to failure based on the annotated data and covariates extracted from the time domain, such as skewness, kurtosis and entropy. The models give a probabilistic prediction of risk over time and allow us to compare the survival function between groups of bearings. We demonstrate our approach on the XJTU and PRONOSTIA datasets. On XJTU, the best result is a 0.70 concordance-index and 0.21 integrated Brier score. On PRONOSTIA, the best is a 0.76 concordance-index and 0.19 integrated Brier score. Our work motivates further work on incorporating censored data in models for predictive maintenance.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Hydrogen provides a clean source of energy that can be produced with the aid of electrolysers. For electrolysers to operate cost-effectively and safely, it is necessary to define an appropriate maintenance strategy. Predictive maintenance is one of such strategies but often relies on data from sensors which can also become faulty, resulting in false information. Consequently, maintenance will not be performed at the right time and failure will occur. To address this problem, the artificial intelligence concept is applied to make predictions on sensor readings based on data obtained from another instrument within the process. In this study, a novel algorithm is developed using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to select the best feature(s) among measured data of the electrolyser, which can best predict the target sensor data for predictive maintenance. The features are used as input into a type of deep neural network called long short-term memory (LSTM) to make predictions. The DLR developed has been compared with those found in literatures within the scope of this study. The results have been excellent and, in fact, have produced the best scores. Specifically, its correlation coefficient with the target variable was practically total (0.99). Likewise, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) between the experimental sensor data and the predicted variable was only 0.1351.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Complex mechanical systems provide a degree of reliability through redundancy. That is, they have duplicate systems, either similar or dissimilar, performing the same function. These duplicate systems will vary in their dynamic properties and may have different vibration transmission\\n paths due to their connections within the overall system. Therefore, the use of redundancy gives rise to different vibrational behaviour of the overall system depending on the machines selected to deliver the intended system output. In some circumstances, it is necessary to minimise vibration\\n levels by selecting a particular system configuration. In large complex systems consisting of multiple sources, this is not a trivial task, and virtually impossible to investigate all possible machinery combinations leading to the lowest vibration levels, whilst delivering the desired output.\\n To address this, a machine learning model has been trained to provide predictions of machinery vibration levels. Data are obtained using an experimental vibration rig, emulating a complex, multi-source mechanical system. The machine learning model is subsequently utilised within a genetic\\n algorithm optimisation routine in order to obtain the system configuration producing the lowest vibration levels at a number of observer locations for a specified system output.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"To achieve efficient inference with a hardware-friendly design, Adder Neural Networks (ANNs) are proposed to replace expensive multiplication operations in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with cheap additions through utilizing <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\\\"LaTeX\\\">$\\\\ell _{1}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-norm for similarity measurement instead of cosine distance. However, we observe that there exists an increasing gap between CNNs and ANNs with reducing parameters, which cannot be eliminated by existing algorithms. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective Norm-Guided Distillation (NGD) method for <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\\\"LaTeX\\\">$\\\\ell _{1}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-norm ANNs to learn superior performance from <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\\\"LaTeX\\\">$\\\\ell _{2}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-norm ANNs. Although CNNs achieve similar accuracy with <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\\\"LaTeX\\\">$\\\\ell _{2}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-norm ANNs, the clustering performance based on <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\\\"LaTeX\\\">$\\\\ell _{2}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-distance can be easily learned by <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\\\"LaTeX\\\">$\\\\ell _{1}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-norm ANNs compared with cross correlation in CNNs. The features in <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\\\"LaTeX\\\">$\\\\ell _{2}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-norm ANNs are encouraged to achieve intra-class centralization and inter-class decentralization to amplify this advantage. Furthermore, the roughly estimated gradients in vanilla ANNs are modified to a progressive approximation from <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\\\"LaTeX\\\">$\\\\ell _{2}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-norm to <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\\\"LaTeX\\\">$\\\\ell _{1}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-norm so that a more accurate optimization can be achieved. Extensive evaluations on several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of NGD on lightweight networks. For example, our method improves ANN by 10.43% with <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\\\"LaTeX\\\">$0.25\\\\times $ </tex-math></inline-formula> GhostNet on CIFAR-100 and 3.1% with <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\\\"LaTeX\\\">$1.0\\\\times $ </tex-math></inline-formula> GhostNet on ImageNet.\",\n",

It is important to determine whether a speech signal is authentic (spoken by a human) or is synthesized and to determine the generation method used to create it. Identifying the synthesis method is known as synthetic speech attribution. In this paper, we propose the use of a transformer deep learning method that analyzes mel-spectrograms for synthetic speech attribution. Our method known as Patchout Spectrogram Attribution Transformer (PSAT) can distinguish new, unseen speech generation methods from those seen during training. PSAT demonstrates high performance in attributing synthetic speech signals. Evaluation on the DARPA SemaFor Audio Attribution Dataset and the ASVSpoof2019 Dataset shows that our method achieves more than 95% accuracy in synthetic speech attribution and performs better than existing deep learning approaches.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"BACKGROUND&AIMS: Histological remission (HR) is advocated and considered as a new therapeutic target in ulcerative colitis (UC). Diagnosis of histologic remission currently relies on biopsy; during this process, patients are at risk for bleeding, infection, and post-biopsy fibrosis. In addition, histologic response scoring is complex and time-consuming, and there is heterogeneity among pathologists. Endocytoscopy (EC) is a novel ultra-high magnification endoscopic technique that can provide excellent in vivo assessment of glands. Based on the EC technique, we propose a neural network model that can assess histological disease activity in UC using EC images to address the above issues. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method can assist patients in precise treatment and prognostic assessment. METHODS: We construct a neural network model for UC evaluation. A total of 5105 images of 154 intestinal segments from 87 patients undergoing EC treatment at a center in China between March 2022 and March 2023 are scored according to the Geboes score. Subsequently, 103 intestinal segments are used as the training set, 16 intestinal segments are used as the validation set for neural network training, and the remaining 35 intestinal segments are used as the test set to measure the model performance together with the validation set. RESULTS: By treating HR as a negative category and histologic activity as a positive category, the proposed neural network model can achieve an accuracy of 0.9, a specificity of 0.95, a sensitivity of 0.75, and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.81. CONCLUSION: We develop a specific neural network model that can distinguish histologic remission/activity in EC images of UC, which helps to accelerate clinical histological diagnosis. keywords: ulcerative colitis; Endocytoscopy; Geboes score; neural network.\",\n",

Aiming at the adaptability of rolling bearings under different working conditions under different fault diameters, an intelligent fault diagnosis method based on the combination of multi-scale convolutional neural network and attention mechanism is proposed. The structure of multi-scale convolution is used to extract features of different dimensions and significantly improved feature extraction capabilities. Besides, the attention mechanism is used to give different weights to data features and pay attention to its important characteristic information. In order to verify the performance of the Multi-scale Convolutional Neural Network-Convolutional Block Attention Module (MSCNN-CBAM) model, the bearing bench dataset of Case Western Reserve University was used for verification. The results show that the approach is efficient in diagnosis and experimental results show that compared with other models, the MSCNN-CBAM model can capture high-quality features more effectively and show strong robustness under different working conditions. The model has a good fault diagnosis capabilities and achieved a classification rate of more than 99%.\",\n",

A low-pass filter was introduced into the Fourier plane to remove the high frequency. This produces a blurred intensity image of the reconstructed beam. A convolutional neural network is used to establish the relationship between the blurred intensity image and the data page. The encoded phase data page can be directly demodulated from a captured intensity image, which is a non-interferometric method without iterations. The function of the filter is to generate the blurred intensity image and to reduce the recording area to improve the recording intensity. Usually, the limit of the aperture is the Nyquist size. Here, by introducing embedded data on the phase data page, the aperture size of the recording can be reduced to smaller than the Nyquist size. A simulation experiment was established to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Backgroundand objectives: Implementation of patient-specific quality assurance (PSQA) is a crucial aspect of precise radiotherapy. Various machine learning-based models have showed potential as virtual quality assurance tools, being capable of accurately predicting the dose verification results of fixed-beam intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans, thereby ensuring safe and efficient treatment for patients. However, there has been no research yet that simultaneously integrates different IMRT techniques to predict the gamma pass rate (GPR) and explain the model.Methods: Retrospective analysis of the 3D dosimetric verification results based on measurements with gamma pass rate criteria of 3%/2\\u00a0mm and 10% dose threshold of 409 pelvic IMRT and VMAT plans was carried out. Radiomics features were extracted from the dose files, from which the XGBoost algorithm based on SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values was used to select the optimal feature subset as the input for the prediction model. The study employed four different machine learning algorithms, namely, random forest (RF), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), to construct predictive models. Sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, and AUC value were calculated to evaluate the classification performance of these models. The SHAP values were utilized to perform a related interpretive analysis on the best performing model.Results: The sensitivities and specificities of the RF, AdaBoost, XGBoost, and LightGBM models were 0.96, 0.82, 0.93, and 0.89, and 0.38, 0.54, 0.62, and 0.62, respectively. The F1 scores and area under the curve (AUC) values were 0.86, 0.81, 0.88, and 0.86, and 0.81, 0.77, 0.85, and 0.83, respectively. The explanation of the model output based on SHAP values can provide a reference basis for medical physicists when adjusting the plan, thereby improving the efficiency and quality of treatment plans.Conclusion: It is feasible to use a machine learning method based on radiomics to establish a gamma pass rate classification prediction model for IMRT and VMAT plans in the pelvis. The XGBoost model performs better in classification than the other three tree-based ensemble models, and global explanations and single-sample explanations of the model output through SHAP values may offer reference for medical physicists to provide high-quality plans, promoting the clinical application and implementation of GPR prediction models, and providing safe and efficient personalized QA management for patients.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Young children spend substantial portions of their waking hours in noisy preschool classrooms. In these environments, children's vocal interactions with teachers are critical contributors to their language outcomes, but manually transcribing these interactions is prohibitive. Using audio from child- and teacher-worn recorders, we propose an automated framework that uses open source software both to classify speakers (ALICE) and to transcribe their utterances (Whisper). We compare results from our framework to those from a human expert for 110 minutes of classroom recordings, including 85 minutes from child-word microphones (n=4 children) and 25 minutes from teacher-worn microphones (n=2 teachers). The overall proportion of agreement, that is, the proportion of correctly classified teacher and child utterances, was .76, with an error-corrected kappa of .50 and a weighted F1 of .76. The word error rate for both teacher and child transcriptions was .15, meaning that 15% of words would need to be deleted, added, or changed to equate the Whisper and expert transcriptions. Moreover, speech features such as the mean length of utterances in words, the proportion of teacher and child utterances that were questions, and the proportion of utterances that were responded to within 2.5 seconds were similar when calculated separately from expert and automated transcriptions. The results suggest substantial progress in analyzing classroom speech that may support children's language development. Future research using natural language processing is underway to improve speaker classification and to analyze results from the application of the automated it framework to a larger dataset containing classroom recordings from 13 children and 4 teachers observed on 17 occasions over one year.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) are critical in ensuring ubiquitous internet coverage, particularly in environments and terrains with unique challenges. The increasing number of wireless devices and services has created a critical need for routing techniques that are more efficient and adaptable. Although conventional routing algorithms exhibit resilience, they frequently remain fixed and fail to adapt to swift fluctuations in network circumstances. By incorporating Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based routing algorithms, this article proposes a novel method for improving the efficacy of WMNs. We present an innovative AI-driven routing algorithm that dynamically adapts to fluctuating network conditions by leveraging reinforcement learning and deep learning techniques. Our methodology considers various elements, including interference, node dependability, bandwidth consumption, and node mobility. In contrast to conventional approaches, the algorithm powered by artificial intelligence perpetually acquires knowledge from its surroundings, forecasting possible breakdowns or congestion, and subsequently redirects data packets along a more efficient trajectory. Experiments performed on simulated and real-world WMN scenarios revealed significant enhancements in packet delivery ratio, latency, and throughput compared to traditional routing methods. In addition, our AI model's adaptability guarantees the network's resistance to external disturbances and its capacity to expand to accommodate an increasing number of nodes. The study's results highlight the capacity of artificial intelligence to fundamentally transform the domain of wireless networking. Incorporating intelligent algorithms into wide-area networks (WMNs) infrastructure can guarantee end-users a more streamlined, effective, and resilient internet experience. Further investigations are warranted to determine whether the proposed method can be implemented in alternative wireless architectures and to enhance the algorithm by utilizing hybrid AI techniques.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"While deep learning models have achieved remarkable success across a range of medical image analysis tasks, deployment of these models in real clinical contexts requires that they be robust to variability in the acquired images. While many methods apply predefined transformations to augment the training data to enhance test-time robustness, these transformations may not ensure the model's robustness to the diverse variability seen in patient images. In this paper, we introduce a novel three-stage approach based on transformers coupled with conditional diffusion models, with the goal of improving model robustness to the kinds of imaging variability commonly encountered in practice without the need for pre-determined data augmentation strategies. To this end, multiple image encoders first learn hierarchical feature representations to build discriminative latent spaces. Next, a reverse diffusion process, guided by the latent code, acts on an informative prior and proposes prediction candidates in a generative manner. Finally, several prediction candidates are aggregated in a bi-level aggregation protocol to produce the final output. Through extensive experiments on medical imaging benchmark datasets, we show that our method improves upon state-of-the-art methods in terms of robustness and confidence calibration. Additionally, we introduce a strategy to quantify the prediction uncertainty at the instance level, increasing their trustworthiness to clinicians using them in clinical practice.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Multimodal Machine Learning has emerged as a prominent research direction across various applications such as Sentiment Analysis, Emotion Recognition, Machine Translation, Hate Speech Recognition, and Movie Genre Classification. This approach has shown promising results by utilizing modern deep learning architectures. Despite the achievements made, challenges remain in data representation, alignment techniques, reasoning, generation, and quantification within multimodal learning. Additionally, assumptions about the dominant role of textual modality in decision-making have been made. However, limited investigations have been conducted on the influence of different modalities in Multimodal Machine Learning systems. This paper aims to address this gap by studying the impact of each modality on multimodal learning tasks. The research focuses on verifying presumptions and gaining insights into the usage of different modalities. The main contribution of this work is the proposal of a methodology to determine the effect of each modality on several Multimodal Machine Learning models and datasets from various tasks. Specifically, the study examines Multimodal Sentiment Analysis, Multimodal Emotion Recognition, Multimodal Hate Speech Recognition, and Multimodal Disease Detection. The study objectives include training SOTA MultiModal Machine Learning models with masked modalities to evaluate their impact on performance. Furthermore, the research aims to identify the most influential modality or set of modalities for each task and draw conclusions for diverse multimodal classification tasks. By undertaking these investigations, this research contributes to a better understanding of the role of individual modalities in multi-modal learning and provides valuable insights for future advancements in this field.\",\n",

To counteract such attacks, we introduce Selective Aggregate Filtering through Filter Rule Refinement. This novel approach monitors traffic aggregates over the IP address hierarchy with hierarchical heavy hitter algorithms. Based on this, it builds effective droplists for upstream filtering to protect network infrastructures. By estimating attack traffic volumes in traffic aggregates with machine learning, filter rule refinement compensates several drawbacks of hierarchical heavy hitters to achieve low false positive and false negative rates. Furthermore, it enables adaptation to dynamic traffic by tracking filter rule precision over time. We evaluate mitigation effectiveness in dynamic situations with challenging mixed legitimate and attack traffic distributions.\",\n",

We also proposed a posture prediction model based on the mathematical representation of nematode shape and deep learning method (Time2vec-LSTM-Attention).

      "      \"abstract\": \"Knowledge tracing tasks involve analyzing students' historical question-answering sequences to assess their knowledge status, enabling the prediction of their future performance. Most existing knowledge tracing models only explore the direct impact of questions or knowledge concepts themselves on students' answers but do not effectively explore the deep relationships between questions and knowledge concepts, which weakens the predictive performance of the models. In addition, the nature of the deep learning black box leads to a lack of interpretability of the knowledge tracing model applying deep learning algorithms. Therefore, we introduce an interpretable deep knowledge tracing model with graph relationship information. It leverages graph attention neural networks to explore fine-grained relationships between questions and knowledge concepts in the original dataset, thus enhancing its predictive performance. Furthermore, DKVMN is employed to capture students' knowledge state for each knowledge concept, and IRT is incorporated to enhance interpretability. Our methodology beats popular knowledge tracing methods in terms of prediction performance, according to experimental results on three genuine public online education datasets, more accurately capturing students' knowledge states for better prediction of their future performance, and enhancing model interpretability.\",\n",

It helps to improve the accuracy, speed, and efficiency of testing, and reduce the cost and effort associated with manual testing. With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) and recently released Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT), new opportunities for automating software testing have emerged. The use of AI in software testing has the potential to revolutionize the quality assurance process, enabling organizations to deliver high-quality software to their customers. Along with implementing ChatGPT into an ad hoc testing process we can implement the following into CI/CD.

      "      \"abstract\": \"The protection of biometric information is rapidly becoming an increasingly significant challenge in the field of data security. In recent years, there has been a precipitous growth in the number of research endeavours being performed in biometrics. This surge in research endeavours has been driven by a growing interest in the discipline. It is still difficult to solve the problem of developing a multimodal biometric system (MBS) with improved accuracy and recognition rate for use in smart cities. The numerous works have all used MBSs, which has led to a reduction in the security criteria that are required. Because of this, the major focus of this study is centred on the creation of a multimodal biometric recognition system (MBRS) via the utilisation of deep learning Fully Convolutional Residual Neural Network (FCRN) classification. A Gaussian filter is first applied to the images obtained from the ear, face, fingerprint, iris, and palmprint databases. This step is performed at the very beginning of the process. This causes the photos to go through pre-processing, which gets rid of the many kinds of noise that were presented. In addition, the grey level co-occurrence matrix, also known as the GLCM, is used to derive the multimodal properties. Following that, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are utilized so that the total number of features can be reduced to the smallest possible amount. The PSO is utilised so that features can be picked and selects the characteristics from the available set that are the most helpful. Finally, the FCRN classifier is used so that the biometric recognition technique can be carried out by using the training PSO features from the test dataset. In conclusion, the findings of the simulation reveal that the implementation of the suggested MBRS-FCRN led to a reduction in losses and an improvement in accuracy in comparison to previous approaches. The proposed MBRS-FCRN achieved an accuracy of 98.179%, sensitivity of 98.346%, and specificity of 98.186% compared to existing methods.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The most severe kind of skin cancer in humans is melanoma. Due to melanoma detection delays, most humans die for years. Effective treatment of melanoma skin cancer depends on early detection. The automatic system will decrease the number of fatal instances brought on by melanoma. In the pathology lab, there are some manual methods for finding melanoma. However, this method may take more time because of the complex dataset. Deep learning models are used to solve this issue. There are numerous melanoma datasets on Kaggle. This experiment will use the ISIC dataset downloaded from Kaggle. The primary goals of the proposed approach are to decrease overfitting, improve model accuracy, minimize error, shorten training periods, and address issues with class imbalance. In a different research paper study, we observed that the ensemble approach in deep learning can give better accuracy than when individual models are used. For the experiment, use blending ensemble learning. This project will use a base model such as CNN, Vgg-16, GoogleNet, and ResNet-50 as a meta-model for the final prediction. The model evaluation will use the confusion matrix, accuracy, and F1 score.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The Transformer-based detectors (i.e., DETR) have demonstrated impressive performance on end-to-end object detection. However, transferring DETR to different data distributions may lead to a significant performance degradation. Existing adaptation techniques focus on model-based approaches, which aim to leverage feature alignment to narrow the distribution shift between different domains. In this study, we propose a hierarchical Prompt Domain Memory (PDM) for adapting detection transformers to different distributions. PDM comprehensively leverages the prompt memory to extract domain-specific knowledge and explicitly constructs a long-term memory space for the data distribution, which represents better domain diversity compared to existing methods. Specifically, each prompt and its corresponding distribution value are paired in the memory space, and we inject top M distribution-similar prompts into the input and multi-level embeddings of DETR. Additionally, we introduce the Prompt Memory Alignment (PMA) to reduce the discrepancy between the source and target domains by fully leveraging the domain-specific knowledge extracted from the prompt domain memory. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art domain adaptive object detection methods on three benchmarks, including scene, synthetic to real, and weather adaptation. Codes will be released.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Atrial fibrillation(AF) is a very dangerous arrhythmia disease that seriously affects human health. Radiofrequency(RF) ablation technique is a new surgical treatment modality that is widely used in the treatment of atrial fibrillation. There are two ablation modes of radiofrequency ablation(RFCA), namely low-power long-duration(LPLD) and high-power short-duration(HPSD). Among them, high-power short-duration radiofrequency catheter ablation significantly improves the efficiency of the procedure and has very few complications, which is a hot topic of current research, but the unpredictable injury characteristics limit the development of radiofrequency ablation. In this study, we will conduct an ex vivo experiment of radiofrequency catheter ablation with high-power short-duration on porcine heart to restore the actual clinical surgical environment as much as possible. The data between the six ablation parameters of power, ablation time, contact force, initial impedance, impedance drop and temperature rise and the four injury characteristics of surface width, maximum width, injury depth and injury volume were compiled to obtain 111 sets of experimental data. Support vector regression(SVR) algorithm was used to predict the data by machine learning regression, and the evaluation index was used to assess the merit of the regression model. According to the results, there was a correlation between ablation parameters and damage characteristics, and the support vector regression model could accurately predict the damage characteristics of the radiofrequency ablation target.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Antibiotic resistance is the ability of bacteria to resist the effects of antibiotics, making infections more difficult to treat and increasing the risk of complications and death. One way to fight antibiotic resistance is by identifying the most effective antibiotics for treating bacterial infections. This can be done through a laboratory test called AST, which is used to determine the susceptibility of bacteria to antibiotics. However, manual AST has several limitations that include time delay, limited accuracy, limited testing capacity, and subjective interpretation of results. Therefore, there is an emergent need for a more reliable and efficient alternative to manual AST. Recently, few works have tried to automate disk diffusion AST through AI-based solutions and mobile applications. However, these works do not support advanced analysis and interpretation of results, do not present evaluation of detection performance, or are not publicly available to download and use. This work proposes PalAST, a cross-platform mobile application that supports automated disk diffusion AST. The application enables biologists to take AST photos and analyze them in real time with minimal human intervention. It uses image processing and a pre-trained machine learning model to detect antibiotic disks in the agar plate and predict bounding circles for inhibition zones. Then, it provides an interpretation of results including the diameters of the inhibition zones, the labels on the antibiotic disks, and the rating of the bacteria as susceptible, intermediate, or resistant to each antibiotic. PalAST also stores the results of tests, allowing users to access and review past test results. PalAST was tested using a number of real AST photos, and the detection performance was evaluated by using common metrics, i.e. precision, recall, and Intersection over Union. We also used expert evaluation through a questionnaire to assess the usability and ease of use of PalAST.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Model extraction attack typically refers to extracting non-public information from a black-box machine learning model. Its unauthorized nature poses significant threat to intellectual property rights of the model owners. By using the well-designed queries and the predictions returned from the victim model, the adversary is able to train a clone model from scratch to obtain similar functionality as victim model. Recently, some methods have been proposed to perform model extraction attacks without using any in-distribution data (Data-free setting). Although these methods have been shown to achieve high clone accuracy, their query budgets are typically around 10 million or even exceed 20 million in some datasets, which lead to a high cost of model stealing and can be easily defended by limiting the number of queries. To illustrate the severe threats induced by model extraction attacks with limited query budget in realistic scenarios, we propose QUDA \\u2013 a novel QUey-limited DAta-free model extraction attack that incorporates GAN pre-trained by public unrelated dataset to provide weak image prior and the technique of deep reinforcement learning to make query generation strategy more efficient. Compared with the state-of-the-art data-free model extraction method, QUDA achieves better results under query-limited condition (0.1M query budget) in FMNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, and even outperforms the baseline method in most cases when QUDA uses only 10% query budget of its. QUDA issued a warning that solely relying on the limited numbers of queries or the confidentiality of training data is not reliable to protect model\\u2019s security and privacy. Potential countermeasures, such as detection-based defense approach, are also provided.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Recent years have witnessed a huge demand for artificial intelligence and machine learning applications in wireless edge networks to assist individuals with real-time services. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a suitable and appealing distributed learning paradigm to deploy these applications at the network edge. Despite the many successful efforts made to apply FL to wireless edge networks, the adopted algorithms mostly follow the same spirit as FedAvg, thereby heavily suffering from the practical challenges of label deficiency and device heterogeneity. These challenges not only decelerate the model training in FL but also downgrade the application performance. In this paper, we focus on the algorithm design and address these challenges by investigating the personalized semi-supervised FL problem and proposing an effective algorithm, named FedCPSL. In particular, the techniques of pseudo-labeling, and interpolation-based model personalization are judiciously combined to provide a new problem formulation for personalized semi-supervised FL. The proposed FedCPSL algorithm employs novel strategies, including adaptive client variance reduction, local momentum, and normalized global aggregation, to combat the challenge of device heterogeneity and boost algorithm convergence. The convergence property of FedCPSL is also thoroughly analyzed and shows that FedCPSL is resilient to both statistical and system heterogeneity, obtaining a sublinear convergence rate. Experimental results on image classification tasks are presented to demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms its counterparts in terms of both convergence speed and application performance.\",\n",

Methods We used Self Organizing Maps machine learning method to analyze gene expression data from leaves of five Vitis vinifera cultivars each treated by four different temperature conditions. The algorithm generated sample-specific \\u201cportraits\\u201d of the normalized gene expression data, revealing distinct patterns related to the temperature conditions applied. Results Our analysis unveiled a connection with vitamin B1 (thiamine) biosynthesis, suggesting a link between temperature regulation and thiamine metabolism, in agreement with thiamine related stress response established in Arabidopsis before. Furthermore, we found that epigenetic mechanisms play a crucial role in regulating the expression of stress-responsive genes at low temperatures in grapevines. Discussion Application of Self Organizing Maps portrayal to vine transcriptomics identified modules of coregulated genes triggered under cold stress. Our machine learning approach provides a promising option for transcriptomics studies in plants.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Fast and accurate infrared (IR) sea\\u2013sky line (SSL) detection could greatly benefit the efficiency of target detection under maritime. However, the traditional SSL detection algorithms are slightly inferior in detection accuracy, while the convolutional neural network (CNN)-based algorithms have high standard hardware and dataset requirements, which are difficult to satisfy in some practical scenes. In this article, a novel concise and intuitive SSL detection algorithm named bisection window and homogeneity principle-based local contrast measure (BHLCM) is proposed. First, a bisection local contrast window (BLCW) is proposed based on the local contrast measure (LCM) and be used for the search of the patches that contain SSL segments along a set of variable preset vertical paths. Then, based on the analysis of the physical characteristics of areas near SSL, the homogeneity principle is proposed to remove the patches containing false SSL segments. Finally, the midpoints of the remaining SSL segments are used to fit the final SSL through random sample consensus (RANSAC). Experimental results based on four IR image sequences with more than 3000 IR images illustrate that compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms, BHLCM not only achieves precision comparable to the most accurate one but also is significantly ahead in speed among most of the algorithms compared. In addition, speed tests about BHLCM based on different hardware platforms show that real-time detection could still be achieved even without high-performance graphics cards. The code and dataset are available at BHLCM https://github.com/FJsRepo/BHLCM.\",\n",

FedSecurity comprises two pivotal components: FedAttacker, which facilitates the simulation of a variety of attacks during FL training, and FedDefender, which implements defensive mechanisms to counteract these attacks. As an open-source library, FedSecurity enhances its usability compared to from-scratch implementations that focus on specific attack/defense scenarios based on the following features: i) It offers extensive customization options to accommodate a broad range of machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, ResNet, and GAN) and FL optimizers (e.g., FedAVG, FedOPT, and FedNOVA); ii) it enables exploring the variability in the effectiveness of attacks and defenses across different datasets and models; and iii) it supports flexible configuration and customization through a configuration file and some provided APIs. We further demonstrate FedSecurity's utility and adaptability through federated training of Large Language Models (LLMs), showcasing its potential to impact a wide range of complex applications.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"One-stream Transformer trackers have shown outstanding performance in challenging benchmark datasets over the last three years, as they enable interaction between the target template and search region tokens to extract target-oriented features with mutual guidance. Previous approaches allow free bidirectional information flow between template and search tokens without investigating their influence on the tracker's discriminative capability. In this study, we conducted a detailed study on the information flow of the tokens and based on the findings, we propose a novel Optimized Information Flow Tracking (OIFTrack) framework to enhance the discriminative capability of the tracker. The proposed OIFTrack blocks the interaction from all search tokens to target template tokens in early encoder layers, as the large number of non-target tokens in the search region diminishes the importance of target-specific features. In the deeper encoder layers of the proposed tracker, search tokens are partitioned into target search tokens and non-target search tokens, allowing bidirectional flow from target search tokens to template tokens to capture the appearance changes of the target. In addition, since the proposed tracker incorporates dynamic background cues, distractor objects are successfully avoided by capturing the surrounding information of the target. The OIFTrack demonstrated outstanding performance in challenging benchmarks, particularly excelling in the one-shot tracking benchmark GOT-10k, achieving an average overlap of 74.6\\\\%.

      "      \"abstract\": \"Digital signal processing (DSP) has been widely adopted in sensor systems, communication systems, digital image processing, artificial intelligence, and Internet of Things applications. However, these applications require circuits for complex arithmetic computation. The logarithmic number system is a method to reduce the implementation area and transmission delay for arithmetic computation in DSP. In this study, we propose antilogarithmic converters with efficient error\\u2013area\\u2013delay products (eADPs) based on the fractional-bit compensation scheme. We propose three mathematical approximations\\u2014case 1, case 2, and case 3\\u2014to approximate the accurate antilogarithmic curve with different DSP requirements. The maximum percentage errors of conversion for case 1, case 2, and case 3 are 1.9089%, 1.7330%, and 1.2063%, respectively. Case 1, case 2, and case 3 can achieve eADP savings of 15.66%, 80.80%, and 84.61% compared with other methods reported in the literature. The proposed eADP-efficient antilogarithmic converters can achieve lower eADP and digitalized circuit implementation. The hardware implementation utilizes Verilog Hardware Description Language and the digital circuits are created via very-large-scale integration by the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company with 0.18 \\u00b5m CMOS technology. This proposed antilogarithmic converter can be efficiently applied in DSP.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Deep neural network quantization is a widely used method in the deployment of mobile or edge devices to effectively reduce memory overhead and speed up inference. However, quantization inevitably leads to a reduction in the performance and equivalence of models. Moreover, access to labeled datasets is often denied as they are considered valuable assets for companies or institutes. Consequently, performing quantization training becomes challenging without sufficient labeled datasets. To address these issues, we propose a novel quantization pipeline named DiffQuant, which can perform quantization training using unlabeled datasets. The pipeline includes two cores: the compression difference (CD) and model compression loss (MCL). The CD can measure the degree of equivalence loss between the full-precision and quantized models, and the MCL supports fine-tuning the quantized models using unlabeled data. In addition, we design a quantization training scheme that allows the quantization of both the batch normalization (BN) layer and the bias. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ResNet18/34/50 networks, maintaining performance with a reduced CD. We achieve Top-1 accuracies of 70.08%, 74.11%, and 76.16% on the ImageNet dataset for the 8-bit quantized ResNet18/34/50 models and reduce the gap to 0.55%, 0.61%, and 0.71% with the full-precision network, respectively. We achieve CD values of only 7.45%, 7.48%, and 8.52%, which allows DiffQuant to further exploit the potential of quantization.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"In recent years, there has been a prominent focus on enhancing the quality of features derived from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) within the field of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) image classification. Targeting this challenge, this article first visualizes the lack of discriminability and generalizability in CNN features through several empirical observations. Subsequently, we explain why these problems arise from a causal perspective, accomplished by means of a structural causal model (SCM) constructed according to the training and testing process of CNNs. This SCM facilitates the identification of variables that affect the quality of PolSAR image feature learning, as well as an intervention on those variables using backdoor adjustment. Building upon this groundwork, a novel causal inference-guided feature enhancement framework is constructed. It can be seamlessly integrated into any CNN-based PolSAR image classifier in a plug-and-play manner, enabling the enhanced classifier to filter out interference information and prevent model overfitting. These two aspects bring better feature discriminability and generalizability, respectively, leading to improved classification performance. Experimental results on four widely-used PolSAR image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. We integrate it into several mainstream methods in the field and show that the accuracy of the enhanced classifier is improved compared to the original model.\",\n",

However, the lack of large-scale annotated datasets has slowed down research in the field, in particular w.r.t. the application of modern deep learning methods. This paper introduces DAACI-VoDAn, a novel dataset for VD that contains 706 full-length music tracks and vocal segment annotations. In addition, we propose a new method for the task that outperforms state of the art methods on DAACI-VoDAn as well as on an existing VD dataset. Our approach combines a convolutional head, that is pre-trained on large amounts of weakly-labeled data, with a temporal-convolutional architecture which models the occurrence of two-dimensional patterns over time.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The increasing demand for immersive experience has greatly promoted the quality assessment research of Light Field Image (LFI). In this paper, we propose an efficient deep discrepancy measuring framework for full-reference light field image quality assessment. The main idea of the proposed framework is to efficiently evaluate the quality degradation of distorted LFIs by measuring the discrepancy between reference and distorted LFI patches. Firstly, a patch generation module is proposed to extract spatio-angular patches and sub-aperture patches from LFIs, which greatly reduces the computational cost. Then, we design a hierarchical discrepancy network based on convolutional neural networks to extract the hierarchical discrepancy features between reference and distorted spatio-angular patches. Besides, the local discrepancy features between reference and distorted sub-aperture patches are extracted as complementary features. After that, the angular-dominant hierarchical discrepancy features and the spatial-dominant local discrepancy features are combined to evaluate the patch quality. Finally, the quality of all patches is pooled to obtain the overall quality of distorted LFIs. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed framework is the first patch-based full-reference light field image quality assessment metric based on deep-learning technology. Experimental results on four representative LFI datasets show that our proposed framework achieves superior performance as well as lower computational complexity compared to other state-of-the-art metrics.\",\n",

The use of deep learning for image segmentation has become a prevalent trend. The widely adopted approach currently is U-Net and its variants. Additionally, with the remarkable success of pre-trained models in natural language processing tasks, transformer-based models like TransUNet have achieved desirable performance on multiple medical image segmentation datasets. In this paper, we conduct a survey of the most representative four medical image segmentation models in recent years. We theoretically analyze the characteristics of these models and quantitatively evaluate their performance on two benchmark datasets (i.e., Tuberculosis Chest X-rays and ovarian tumors). Finally, we discuss the main challenges and future trends in medical image segmentation. Our work can assist researchers in the related field to quickly establish medical segmentation models tailored to specific regions.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Many large and complex deep neural networks have been shown to provide higher performance on various computer vision tasks. However, very little is known about the relationship between the complexity of the input data along with the type of noise and the depth needed for correct classification. Existing studies do not address the issue of common corruptions adequately, especially in understanding what impact these corruptions leave on the individual part of a deep neural network. Therefore, we can safely assume that the classification (or misclassification) might be happening at a particular layer(s) of a network that accumulates to draw a final correct or incorrect prediction. In this paper, we introduce a novel concept of corruption depth, which identifies the location of the network layer/depth until the misclassification persists. We assert that the identification of such layers will help in better designing the network by pruning certain layers in comparison to the purification of the entire network which is computationally heavy. Through our extensive experiments, we present a coherent study to understand the processing of examples through the network. Our approach also illustrates different philosophies of example memorization and a one-dimensional view of sample or query difficulty. We believe that the understanding of the corruption depth can open a new dimension of model explainability and model compression, where in place of just visualizing the attention map, the classification progress can be seen throughout the network.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The willingness to trust predictions formulated by automatic algorithms is key in a wide range of domains. However, a vast number of deep architectures are only able to formulate predictions without associated uncertainty.In this study, we propose a method to convert a standard neural network into a Bayesian neural network and estimate the variability of predictions by sampling different networks similar to the original one at each forward pass.We combine our method with a tunable rejection-based approach that employs only the fraction of the data, i.e., the share that the model can classify with an uncertainty below a user-set threshold. We test our model in a large cohort of brain images from patients with Alzheimer's disease and healthy controls, discriminating the former and latter classes based on morphometric images exclusively.We demonstrate how combining estimated uncertainty with a rejection-based approach increases classification accuracy from 0.86 to 0.95 while retaining 75% of the test set. In addition, the model can select the cases to be recommended for, e.g., expert human evaluation due to excessive uncertainty. Importantly, our framework circumvents additional workload during the training phase by using our network \\u201cturned into Bayesian\\u201d to implicitly investigate the loss landscape in the neighborhood of each test sample in order to determine the reliability of the predictions.We believe that being able to estimate the uncertainty of a prediction, along with tools that can modulate the behavior of the network to a degree of confidence that the user is informed about (and comfortable with), can represent a crucial step in the direction of user compliance and easier integration of deep learning tools into everyday tasks currently performed by human operators.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Humans are capable of acquiring new knowledge and transferring learned knowledge into different domains, incurring a small forgetting. The same ability, called Continual Learning, is challenging to achieve when operating with neural networks due to the forgetting affecting past learned tasks when learning new ones. This forgetting can be mitigated by replaying stored samples from past tasks, but a large memory size may be needed for long sequences of tasks; moreover, this could lead to overfitting on saved samples. In this paper, we propose a novel regularisation approach and a novel incremental classifier called, respectively, Margin Dampening and Cascaded Scaling Classifier. The first combines a soft constraint and a knowledge distillation approach to preserve past learned knowledge while allowing the model to learn new patterns effectively. The latter is a gated incremental classifier, helping the model modify past predictions without directly interfering with them. This is achieved by modifying the output of the model with auxiliary scaling functions. We empirically show that our approach performs well on multiple benchmarks against well-established baselines, and we also study each component of our proposal and how the combinations of such components affect the final results.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"\\n Compared with ordinary concrete, foamed concrete has the advantages of light weight, high fluidity, good thermal and sound insulation properties. It has been initially applied in the construction industry. As the most basic research content of foamed concrete, the strength prediction model has received widespread attention from scholars. In this paper, the existing foamed concrete strength prediction models were summarized. The development status of the traditional empirical model based on theory or experiment and the artificial intelligence model based on computer technology were analyzed, and the advantages and disadvantages of each model were described comprehensively. The following conclusions can be drawn: \\u2460Porosity is an important factor affecting the density and compressive strength of foamed concrete. Considering pore structure and volume composition will be more convenient and accurate to predict the strength. \\u2461 As for gel-space ratio model, considering the contribution of different hydration products produced by the cementitious materials to the strength is helpful to improve the accuracy of the prediction model. \\u2462 The artificial intelligence model overcomes the shortcomings of less factors in the empirical model and large amount of experiments with high cost, which makes the strength prediction more effective and precise. This paper provides a train of thought for further research on the strength prediction model of foamed concrete. The development of foamed concrete strength prediction model can provide theoretical guidance for the design of foamed concrete, and is of great significance for promoting the application of foamed concrete in various occasions.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Noticing the vital role of cross-border trade has made Customs plays a crucial role not only in maintaining supply chain but also in securing government revenue from intentional fraud. Given the huge volume of international trade and limited workforce, Customs across the world must implement efficient and effective risk management. This paper proposes XBNet, an ensemble of tree-based algorithms with deep learning algorithms, to detect fraud in import activity. The strength of XBNet is combining gradient-boosted trees with neural networks where the weights, bias, and loss are adjusted simultaneously with the importance features of each tree in each layer. The object of this study is Import Declaration data from four Customs Offices, and the model is set for each Customs office to capture fraud patterns related to their region.\\u00a0 We compared the model with two different parameters and concluded the models with learning rates = 1%, number of hidden layers = 2, activation function = sigmoid, and number of epochs = 100 as the most suitable for the Belawan, Merak, and Makassar and model with number of hidden layers = 2, number of epochs = 50 and other parameters are set the same as the most suitable for Tanjung Emas.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"This study aimed to establish chemometric models using Raman spectroscopy data for biochemical monitoring of rabies Virus\\u2010Like Particles (VLP) production based on baculovirus/insect cell system. The models were developed using fresh and stored samples from the initial development stages (Schott culture flasks). The following modeling techniques were assessed: partial least squares (PLS) and artificial neural networks (ANN). The effects of spectral filtering approaches, spectral ranges (400\\u20131850\\u2009cm\\u22121; 100\\u20133425\\u2009cm\\u22121), and sample cryopreservation were also considered. The applicability of the models was evaluated using experimental data from assays carried out in a benchtop bioreactor.The results showed that the prediction capacity of the chemometric models was negatively impacted when samples from rabies VLP production were cryopreserved. Further studies are needed to confirm the maximum storage time for samples without a significant difference in model predictions compared to those from an in line database. The dilution of the sample should be kept constant throughout the rabies VLP development stages. A nonlinear correlation was observed between dilution and the predicted values of biochemical parameters from Raman spectral data. The choice of spectral filtering has a major impact on the prediction accuracy of chemometric models.The optimal filtering approach should be individually optimized for each biochemical parameter. The ANN models were significantly more suitable for biochemical monitoring than the PLS approach. The 400\\u20131850\\u2009cm\\u22121 Raman shift range is recommended for biochemical monitoring of rabies VLP using a baculovirus/insect cell platform when samples are cell\\u2010free.This article is protected by copyright.

The first artificial intelligence (AI)-based pediatric migraine diagnosis model was made utilizing a database of questionnaires obtained from a previous epidemiological study, the Itoigawa Benizuwaigani Study. Methods The AI-based headache diagnosis model was created based on the internal validation based on a retrospective investigation of 909 patients (636 training dataset for model development and 273 test dataset for internal validation) aged six to 17 years diagnosed based on the International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rd edition. The diagnostic performance of the AI model was evaluated. Results The dataset included 234/909 (25.7%) pediatric or adolescent patients with migraine. The mean age was 11.3 (standard deviation 3.17) years. The model\\u2019s accuracy, sensitivity (recall), specificity, precision, and F-values for the test dataset were 94.5%, 88.7%, 96.5%, 90.0%, and 89.4%, respectively. Conclusions The AI model exhibited high diagnostic performance for pediatric and adolescent migraine. It holds great potential as a powerful tool for diagnosing these conditions, especially when secondary headaches are ruled out. Nonetheless, further data collection and external validation are necessary to enhance the model\\u2019s performance and ensure its applicability in real-world settings.\",\n",

Project moveSMART aims to introduce learning activities into elementary classrooms that address computer science concepts in a way that integrates with core curriculum requirements and promotes physical activity. In this paper, we explore an extension to an initial set of Project moveSMART computer science learning activities to introduce elementary students to machine learning concepts in a way that is integrated with required learning objectives covered in a Physical Education course. Specifically, students use the BBC micro:bit and its on board sensors to capture rhythmic movement data, explore and analyze patterns in the data, and use a learned \\\"dance move recognition\\\" application that uses their data in order to learn about machine learning in an age appropriate way. To demonstrate feasibility of supporting dance move recognition on the resource-constrained device, we developed a prototype, which is able to detect 5 different dance moves with a 96.6% accuracy.\",\n",

An off-the-shelf petrained ViT is directly deployed for generalizable and transferable feature extraction, which is followed by training-free feature enhancement. The best-prototype pairs (BPPs) are searched for in support and query images based on appearance similarity, to yield instance-unaware candidate keypoints.Then, the entire graph with all candidate keypoints as vertices are divided to sub-graphs according to the feature distributions on the graph edges. Finally, each sub-graph represents an object instance. AnyOKP is evaluated on real object images collected with the cameras of a robot arm, a mobile robot, and a surgical robot, which not only demonstrates the cross-category flexibility and instance awareness, but also show remarkable robustness to domain shift and viewpoint change.\",\n",

In this study, we present a novel model that simultaneously maintains both joint graph embeddings and feature maps as two separated branches and communicates information between them, aiming to enable the model to leverage both long-range semantic relationships and local textile information effectively. We evaluate our experiment on PoseTrack18 dataset and compare its performance with existing state-of-the-art methods. Our model achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 80.2, which, while not out-performed, is competitive with existing state-of-the-art methods. As most previous methods solely use either feature maps or joint embeddings to generate their prediction, further research will be conducted to explore if parallelly combining feature maps and joint embeddings with them can further enhance the result.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"This research introduces a hybrid deep learning approach to perform real-time forecasting of passenger traffic flow for the metro railway system (MRS). By integrating long short-term memory (LSTM) and the graph convolutional network (GCN), a hybrid deep learning neural network named the graph convolutional memory network (GCMN) was constructed and trained for accurate real-time prediction of passenger traffic flow for the MRS. Data collected of the traffic flow in Delhi\\u2019s metro rail network system in the period from October 2012 to May 2017 were utilized to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed model. The results indicate that (1) the developed method provides accurate predictions of the traffic flow with an average coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.920, RMSE of 368.364, and MAE of 549.527, and (2) the GCMN model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including LSTM and the light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM). This study contributes to the state of practice in proposing a novel framework that provides reliable estimations of passenger traffic flow. The developed model can also be used as a benchmark for planning and upgrading works of the MRS by metro owners and architects.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Magnetic flux leakage (MFL) testing of pipelines is of great significance to ensure the safe operation of pipelines. However, the traditional depth learning method has some limitations for accurate detection of pipeline defects. On the basis of the existing YOLOV7 neural network structure, this paper proposes a method based on feature reuse and structure re-parameterization (FRSR) for magnetic flux leakage defect detection. First, the feature reuse split-attention (FRS) module is added to the backbone to achieve better speed precision balance. Secondly, a structure re-parameterization deformable convolutional (Repdcn) module is proposed to efficiently fuse features of different levels, construct weights during training, and fuse during reasoning. The experiment proves the effectiveness of the proposed method. The detection accuracy is improved from 83.6% to 88.9%.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"A DC microgrid\\u2019s tightly regulated DC/DC converter encounters significant challenges in voltage stability, primarily due to the negative incremental resistance of constant power loads (CPLs). Conventional controllers often struggle with load variations and changes in system parameters. Therefore, there has been growing interest in adaptive machine learning algorithms, such as Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), to improve voltage regulation. This paper presents an end-to-end DRL framework based on a modified Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm. The framework is designed to directly control power switches for regulating the voltage of a DC/DC buck converter that supplies power to CPLs. Real-time experiments were conducted using OPAL-RT to validate the approach under diverse load cycles and converter parameter changes.Comparative analysis against other DRL-based control strategies, including Deep Q-learning (DQN) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), demonstrated the superior static and dynamic voltage response of the proposed modified TD3 DRL controller, particularly in scenarios involving load and parametric variations.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Dravet syndrome (DS) is an epileptic encephalopathy caused by mutations in the Scn1a gene encoding the \\u03b11 subunit of the Nav1.1 sodium channel, which is associated with recurrent and generalized seizures, highly resistant to antiepileptic drugs, which is related to cognitive impairment, developmental delays, hyperactivity, dysautonomia, attention deficit, language impairment, autistic features, even leading to death. GABAergic interneurons are particularly affected, where the Nav1.1 channel is mainly located and the consequent imbalance between excitation and inhibition triggers brain hyperexcitability and seizures, altering the correct functioning of neural networks involved in cognitive processes.Glial reactivity and neuroinflammatory processes have been shown to be present in childhood epileptic processes and therefore cytokines may exert a neuromodulatory role directly impacting neuronal excitability. Indeed, astrocytes have been documented to be involved in the pathogenesis of epilepsy, regulating neurotransmitter and ion concentrations.In our experimental model of DS (Syn\\u2010Cre/Scn1aWT/A1783V), inflammatory events in the prefrontal cortex and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus expressed as an increase in GFAP (astrocyte marker) and Iba\\u20101 (microglia marker) immunoreactivity have been observed, in addition to morphological changes compatible with activated astrocytes and microglia.The retina is a projection of the brain, and in several pathologies affecting the central nervous system, such as neurodegenerative diseases, correlation between changes occurring in the brain and those occurring in the retina has been shown. Therefore, the analyse of the changes that may occur in retinal glial cells (astrocytes and microglia) in an experimental model of DS, and the correlation with the alterations observed in some specific cerebral areas of these animals could be good predictive and prognostic biomarkers for future treatment.This study analyzes the retinal histological changes in glial cells (microglia and astrocytes), retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and GABAergic amacrine cells in an experimental model of DS (Syn\\u2010Cre/Scn1aWT/A1783V) compared to a control group at postnatal day (PND) 25. Retinal whole\\u2010mounts were labelled with anti\\u2010GFAP, anti\\u2010Iba\\u20101, anti\\u2010Brn3a and anti\\u2010GAD65/67. Signs of microglial and astroglial activation and the number of Brn3a+ and GAD65+ 67+ cells were quantified. We found retinal activation of astroglial and microglial cells but not death of RGCs and GABAergic amacrine cells. These changes are similar to those found at the level of the hippocampus in the same experimental model in PND25, indicating a relationship between brain and retinal changes in DS. This suggests that the retina could serve as a possible biomarker in DS.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI), liver damage caused by drugs, represents a significant factor contributing to the failure of clinical trials. Remarkably, the drug development process, which entails an extensive timeline spanning several years and incurring costs of billions of dollars to achieve Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, could greatly benefit from early DILI prediction. Furthermore, through the utilization of DILI prediction, clinicians can obtain valuable insights into the potential risks associated with medication, empowering them to make more informed decisions when prescribing drugs to patients. We employ Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to predict DILI based on drug structures. GNNs consist of node aggregation, which gathers node representations, and graph pooling, which compiles node representations to portray the graph as a single vector. While the graph pooling method built on Set Transformer outperforms existing techniques, we identify a limitation: Set Transformer uses a random seed vector as the query vector that cannot differentiate between graphs of varied structures. Moreover, it potentially lacks expressiveness, as it is randomly defined without prior knowledge and relies on a limited number of seed vectors. To overcome the issues, we introduce Molecular Transformer that employs unique molecular representations as the query vectors. We find that using drug toxicity information extracted from relevant knowledge-bases as the query vector yields the best performance.\",\n",

However, navigating the pages of a web application can be difficult due to dynamic page generation. In particular, the inputs for the web form fields can affect the resulting pages and subsequent navigation. Therefore, choosing the inputs and the order of clicks on a web page is essential for an effective web crawler to achieve high code coverage. This paper proposes a set of actions to quickly fill in web form fields and uses reinforcement learning algorithms to train a convolutional neural network (CNN). The trained agent, named iRobot, can autonomously select actions to guide the web crawler to maximize code coverage. We experimentally compared different reinforcement learning algorithms, neural networks, and actions. The results show that our CNN network with the proposed actions performs better than other neural networks in terms of branch coverage using the Deep Q-learning (DQN) or proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm. Furthermore, compared to previous studies, iRobot can increase branch coverage by about 1.7% while reducing training time to 12.54%.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Differential drive mobile robots, being widely used in several industrial and domestic applications, are increasingly demanding when concerning precision and satisfactory maneuverability. In the present paper, the problem of independently controlling the velocity and orientation angle of a differential drive mobile robot is investigated by developing an appropriate two stage nonlinear controller embedded on board and also by using the measurements of the speed and accelerator of the two wheels, as well as taking remote measurements of the orientation angle and its rate. The model of the system is presented in a nonlinear state space form that includes unknown additive terms arising from external disturbances and actuator faults. Based on the nonlinear model of the system, the respective I/O relation is derived, and a two-stage nonlinear measurable output feedback controller, analyzed into an internal and an external controller, is designed. The internal controller aims to produce a decoupled inner closed-loop system of linear form, regulating the linear velocity and angular velocity of the mobile robot independently. The internal controller is of the nonlinear PD type and uses real time measurements of the angular velocities of the active wheels of the vehicle, as well as the respective accelerations. The external controller aims toward the regulation of the orientation angle of the vehicle. It is of a linear, delayed PD feedback form, offering feedback from the remote measurements of the orientation angle and angular velocity of the vehicle, which are transmitted to the controller through a wireless network. Analytic formulae are derived for the parameters of the external controller to ensure the stability of the closed-loop system, even in the presence of the wireless transmission delays, as well as asymptotic command following for the orientation angle. To compensate for measurement noise, external disturbances, and actuator faults, a metaheuristic algorithm is proposed to evaluate the remaining free controller parameters. The performance of the proposed control scheme is evaluated through a series of computational experiments, demonstrating satisfactory behavior.\",\n",

These were blindly estimated using cyclostationary signal processing (CSP) and were then input into the CAP for training and classification. The classification performance and the generalization abilities of the proposed approach were tested using two distinct datasets that contained the same types of digitally modulated signals, but had distinct generation parameters. The results showed that the classification of digitally modulated signals using CAPs and CCs proposed in the paper outperformed alternative approaches for classifying digitally modulated signals that included conventional classifiers that employed CSP-based techniques, as well as alternative DL-based classifiers that used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or residual networks (RESNETs) with the in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) data used for training and classification.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The lack of diversity in genomic datasets, currently skewed towards individuals of European ancestry, presents a challenge in developing inclusive biomedical models. The scarcity of such data is particularly evident in labeled datasets that include genomic data linked to electronic health records. To address this gap, this paper presents PopGenAdapt, a genotype-to-phenotype prediction model which adopts semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) techniques originally proposed for computer vision. PopGenAdapt is designed to leverage the substantial labeled data available from individuals of European ancestry, as well as the limited labeled and the larger amount of unlabeled data from currently underrepresented populations. The method is evaluated in underrepresented populations from Nigeria, Sri Lanka, and Hawaii for the prediction of several disease outcomes. The results suggest a significant improvement in the performance of genotype-to-phenotype models for these populations over state-of-the-art supervised learning methods, setting SSDA as a promising strategy for creating more inclusive machine learning models in biomedical research.Our code is available at https://github.com/AI-sandbox/PopGenAdapt.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"This paper aims to provide scientometric and content analysis towards e-commerce and social media research in Asia. The Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus databases were used in searching for articles. There were 884 (433 publications from the Web of Science and 451 articles from Scopus) papers analysed. Based on the analysis of two databases, the number of publications from the Web of Science database showed a significant increase yearly. In comparison, the Scopus database showed fluctuating growth every year. One of the countries that enormously contributed to the research was China, which can be seen from the author\\u2019s and country\\u2019s analyses. The ACM International Conference Proceeding Series was the most contributing conference proceedings. Based on the keyword results, there are five keywords that appear most often. Referring to the data from the last two years (2021\\u20132022), the keywords \\u201cmachine learning\\u201d and \\u201csocial media marketing\\u201d are the most frequently used. These two keywords are most often associated with e-commerce and social media keywords. These findings are expected to provide a substantial understanding towards e-commerce and social media research, particularly in the Asian region. This paper will assist researchers in understanding new topics, collaborating with other researchers, and determining relevant sources and countries. Analysed keywords can inspire new research. Consequently, researchers can learn about new technology, societal changes, and impending challenges and opportunities by tracking keyword trends.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The flying rocks in mining blasting operations pose a great threat to safety production, and the reasonable division of safety blasting scope is of great significance for production operations. In response to the problem of the farthest scattering distance of flying rocks in mining blasting operations, based on the excellent nonlinear mapping ability of BP neural network and mature research on its theory and application, WOA (whale optimization algorithm) is used to optimize the BP neural network, improving its weak global search ability and poor anti-interference ability. And adaptive weight adjustment is introduced, and an improved WOA-BP neural network model is applied to predict the farthest scattering distance of flying rocks in mining blasting. The minimum burden of blasting, unit consumption of blasting explosives, and maxi-mum charge weight of a single hole, which have a greater impact on the distance of flying rocks during blasting operation, are selected as input variables. The experimental results show that the average absolute error MAE, mean square error MSE, root mean square error RMSE, and average absolute percentage error MAPE of the improved WOA-BP model are 0.52283, 0.60303, 0.77655, and 2.8102%, respectively, which are better than the comparison model, indicating that the prediction accuracy of the model is high, it can provide guidance for actual mine blasting production.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) has been proposed as a possible response option to limit global warming and its societal consequences. However, the climate impacts of such intervention are unclear. Here, an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) framework is introduced to quantify how distinguishable an SAI climate might be from a pre\\u2010deployment climate. A suite of neural networks is trained on Earth system model data to learn to distinguish between pre\\u2010 and post\\u2010deployment periods across a variety of climate variables. The network accuracy is analogous to the \\u201cclimate distinguishability\\u201d between the periods, and the corresponding distinctive patterns are identified using XAI methods. For many variables, the two periods are less distinguishable under SAI than under a no\\u2010SAI scenario, suggesting that the specific intervention modeled decelerates future climatic changes and leads to a less novel climate than the no\\u2010SAI scenario. Other climate variables for which the intervention has negligible effect are also highlighted.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Daily solar radiation forecasting has recently become critical in developing solar energy and its integration into grid systems. Despite the huge number of proposed forecasting techniques, an accurate estimation remains a significant challenge because of the non-stationary variation of solar radiation components due to the continuously changing climatic conditions. Usually, several input data predictors are used for the forecasting process, which can cause redundancy and correlation between data features. This work assesses a set of feature selection techniques to check their ability to select the relevant predictors and reduce redundant and irrelevant information. An Artificial Neural Network is used to fit the measured solar radiation based on the selected features. The developed model is evaluated through various objective evaluation metrics using historical data of three years measured at the Ghardaiaregion inAlgeria. Results show the effectiveness of the proposed method, where values of 0,0189, 0.0286, 5.4387, and 98.28% have been found as MABE, RMSE, nRMSE and r, respectively.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Education is recognised as a viable pathway to a better future. It is not a linear rite of passage but a meandering recognition of learning along the way. The advocacy of education for all, internationally, has led to education policy implementation across our global citizenship albeit at differing levels of accessibility and quality. It is widely recognised that the seminal work of Freire, Rousseau and Dewey have embedded the importance of active learning and critical pedagogy in our modern society. But have our leaders of education sufficiently recognised the need to promote education as a sustainable, complementary activity to social and caring aspects of our society. \\n \\nThis paper focuses on strategies used to build a sense of community in a classroom of educationalists who through their own learning experiences gain empowerment.\\u00a0 Drawing on 3 iterations of delivering a module in synchronous virtual classroom, the strategies adopted are outlined, the overall theme is to enable the building of trustworthy relationships and to teach educationalists to embed beliefs and values into their teaching practice. Aspects of the induction period are designed to foster resilience and wellbeing in the teacher cohort for digital and physical life so that students feel nurtured and gain confidence to grow and empower others within the learning lifecycle. \\n \\nFollowing on from the global pandemic, most formal education ecosystems had to temporarily pivot to digital education. Reflection and critical thinking beyond COVID position digital education at a juncture that needs careful consideration to understand the giant leap required to utilise advancements in technology in a classroom. This paper presents a pedagogical approach that tightly couples classroom dialogue with the application of existing technology for teaching and learning at level 9 (Masters) to surmount a sense of uncomfortableness encountered for teachers when faced with moving from a whole group, self-contained classroom approach to a multi-faceted learning ecosystem. Furthermore, the case studies described here address complexity in the classroom, acknowledging the \\u2018valley of death\\u2019 approach used in transitioning research into practice, and furthering our understanding how innovative technologies only make a difference when deployed and used in line with user needs and requirements (Maughan et. al, 2018). \\n \\nStudents describe how they overcome fear from one\\u2019s own comfort zone toward recognising the power of teachers as change agents using an array of community communication platforms to equip and enhance their toolkit with engagement tools tailored for their subject expert domain needs.\\u00a0 \\n \\nTechnology is a critical enabler to access knowledge, resources and people and has empowered those unable to engage with traditional educational settings to gain formal and informal knowledge whilst making learning more fun and engaging alongside other life responsibilities. Education as a career has expanded, teachers, tutors, lecturers, instructional designers, social and community enterprises, data analysts, database architects, facilitators all contribute to a complex education ecosystems that aspire to equality, inclusion and diversity. The population in this study includes diverse educationalists contexts and demonstrates the use of ice-breakers (Eggleston and Smith, 2004). This paper details examples of community building over a number of semesters delivering the same module to different cohorts. It illuminates the difficult induction period whilst students gain trust within small groups and overcome challenges that are presented. The results identify mechanisms that foster a sense of urgency to advocate for change, overcome complacency in classroom and introduce experimentation as a lever to learning in a failsafe ecosystem. Fear is identified as a concept that prevents the use of some technology due to its unpredictability and teacher legacy for being the person at the top of the class with all the knowledge. Times have changed, creativity is key and teachers are realising that they must prepare their students for failure in addition to success and that they need to model experimentation and failure to demonstrate that recovery and problem based learning prevails in a knowledge economy. As educator's compliance is a critical factor to meet the quality standards of our trade, meeting learning outcomes is just one part of the learning journey, gaining trust, delivery of engaging content and the realisation that students need an education ecosystem that promotes a nurture environment, self-actualisation and phronesis.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Intrusion detection systems are used to detect attacks on a network. Machine learning (ML) approaches have been widely used to build such intrusion detection systems (IDSs) because they are more accurate when built from a very large and representative dataset. Recently, one of the benchmark datasets that are used to build ML-based intrusion detection models is the CICIDS2017 dataset. The data set is contained in eight groups and was collected from the Data Set & Repository of the Canadian Institute of Cyber Security. The data set is available in both PCAP and net flow formats. This study used the net flow records in the CIDIDS2017 dataset, as they were found to contain newer attacks, very large, and useful for traffic analysis. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques were used to reveal various characteristics of the dataset. The general objective is to provide more insight into the nature, structure, and issues of the data set so as to identify the best ways to use it to achieve improved ML-based IDS models. Furthermore, some of the open problems that can arise from the use of the dataset in any machine learning-based intrusion detection systems are highlighted and possible solutions are briefly discussed. The EDA techniques used revealed important relationships between the input variables and the target class. The study concluded that the EDA can better influence the decision about future IDS research using the dataset.\\u00a0\",\n",

To this end, big data on terrorism was obtained from research institutes specializing in terrorism, articles and documents posted on various portals and SNS were collected, put into machine learning, and analyzed and learned, and the results were confirmed. The analysis results are as follows. First, as a result of conducting K-Means Clustering, a representative unsupervised learning among machine learning techniques, eight regional clusters of terrorism occurred around the world in 2021 (near Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of the Congo, India, Iraq, Myanmar, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Somalia). Next, as a result of clustering by type of terrorism, assassination using weapons excluding explosives, kidnapping or kidnapping targeting key facilities were identified. In addition, as a result of clustering around the means used in terrorism, it was confirmed that there were many explosives ahead, but there were differences according to the cluster. Finally, clusters of military, police, government personnel, civilians, and private property were identified as a result of clustering centered on targets of terrorism. Second, as a result of sentiment analysis by setting unstructured texts on terrorism events as research subjects, it was confirmed that there were differences in views on terrorism between terrorism researchers and the general public. Based on these research results, policy suggestions were made on ways to prevent terrorism.\",\n",

Our theory both simplifies and strengthens existing analyses in online conformal prediction. Experiments on 4-week-ahead forecasting of statewide COVID-19 death counts in the U.S. show an improvement in coverage over the ensemble forecaster used in official CDC communications. We also run experiments on predicting electricity demand, market returns, and temperature using autoregressive, Theta, Prophet, and Transformer models. We provide an extendable codebase for testing our methods and for the integration of new algorithms, data sets, and forecasting rules.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Tactical planning in timber harvesting involves aspects related to forest macro-planning and, particularly, the allocation of resources and sequencing of activities, all of which affect the allocation of timber in forest yards and roads and the productivity of forest machines. Data-driven approaches encourage the use of information obtained from data to enhance decision-making efficiency and support the development of short-term strategies. Therefore, our investigation was intended to determine whether a data-driven approach can generate sufficient input for modeling forwarder productivity in timber forwarding in Pinus and Eucalyptus planted forests, to support tactical planning. We utilized 3812 instances of raw data that were generated over a 36-month period. The data were collected from 23 loggers who operated in Pinus and Eucalyptus planted forests. We applied 22 regression algorithms that applied a supervised learning method from an experimental machine learning approach to the data instances. We evaluated the fitted models using three performance metrics. Out of the tested algorithms, the default mode of light gradient boosting produced a root mean squared error of 14.80 m3 h\\u22121, a mean absolute error of 2.70, and a coefficient of determination of 0.77. Therefore, data-driven methods adequately support forwarder productivity modeling in timber forwarding in planted forests and help forest managers with tactical planning.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The study of motor disorders due to neurodegenerative diseases (NDD) is assuming a central role in healthcare systems, this is certainly due to the needs of early recognition systems that can allow a better management of the patients daily-life. Many studies in the literature faced the problem of finding digital biomarkers from data collected through gait experiments to discriminate between control (CN) and NDD groups without systematically face the problem of which gait time-series were more appropriate to extract opportune descriptors for characterizing the NDD considered. In this work, such problem was modeled through a machine learning approach. Thus, 6 time-dependent spectral features (PSDTD) were extracted from 4 gait time-series, i.e., stride (SR), stance (SA), swing (SW) and double support (DS) duration intervals. A publicly available data set containing data of CN, Parkinson's (PD), Huntington's (HD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) diseases was employed to the purpose. Low error rates using leave one out validation scheme were obtained using PSDTD features computed over DS and SA for CN-PD and CN-HD classification, i.e., error rate < 0.1 for DS and < 0.15 for SA. Regarding CN-ALS classification, best results were obtained using SA features, i.e. error rate <0.07. This supports the research line that dynamic equilibrium phases of the gait can hide important biomarkers for the characterization of different NDD.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"SCA is an influential method used in physical cryptanalysis. Generally, the assessment of SCA security is carried out post-production in typical industrial procedures. This post-production analysis, however, is prone to errors, costly, and time intensive. Thus, to heighten efficiency, it has been proposed to carry out SCA analysis during design-time, drawing inspiration from the ethos of hardware/software co-design. This paper first introduces the limitations of traditional embedded system software/hardware design and the process of software/hardware co-design and a general SCA leakage model, followed by an overview of the process behind a design-time security analysis. Next, we establish a versatile simulation and analytical framework to evaluate various SCA leakages. In conclusion, we provide a demonstrated experiment that carries out a design data SCA analysis for the crypto-chip integrated having an AES-128 core.\",\n",

Various bandit algorithms have been applied to real-world applications due to their ability of tackling the exploitation-exploration dilemma. Motivated by online recommendation scenarios, in this paper, we propose a framework named Graph Neural Bandits (GNB) to leverage the collaborative nature among users empowered by graph neural networks (GNNs). Instead of estimating rigid user clusters as in existing works, we model the \\\"fine-grained\\\" collaborative effects through estimated user graphs in terms of exploitation and exploration respectively. Then, to refine the recommendation strategy, we utilize separate GNN-based models on estimated user graphs for exploitation and adaptive exploration. Theoretical analysis and experimental results on multiple real data sets in comparison with state-of-the-art baselines are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The reliable operation of industrial equipment is imperative for ensuring both safety and enhanced production efficiency. Machine learning technology, particularly the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), has emerged as a valuable tool for achieving effective fault warning in industrial settings. Despite its success, the practical application of LightGBM encounters challenges in diverse scenarios, primarily stemming from the multitude of parameters that are intricate and challenging to ascertain, thus constraining computational efficiency and accuracy. In response to these challenges, we propose a novel innovative hybrid algorithm that integrates an Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (AOA), Simulated Annealing (SA), and new search strategies. This amalgamation is designed to optimize LightGBM hyperparameters more effectively. Subsequently, we seamlessly integrate this hybrid algorithm with LightGBM to formulate a sophisticated fault warning system. Validation through industrial case studies demonstrates that our proposed algorithm consistently outperforms advanced methods in both prediction accuracy and generalization ability. In a real-world water pump application, the algorithm we proposed achieved a fault warning accuracy rate of 90%. Compared to three advanced algorithms, namely, Improved Social Engineering Optimizer-Backpropagation Network (ISEO-BP), Long Short-Term Memory-Convolutional Neural Network (LSTM-CNN), and Grey Wolf Optimizer-Light Gradient Boosting Machine (GWO-LightGBM), its Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) decreased by 7.14%, 17.84%, and 13.16%, respectively. At the same time, its R-Squared value increased by 2.15%, 7.02%, and 3.73%, respectively. Lastly, the method we proposed also holds a leading position in the success rate of a water pump fault warning. This accomplishment provides robust support for the timely detection of issues, thereby mitigating the risk of production interruptions.\",\n",

Attention Residual U-net is a combination of existing models (Convolutional Neural Network U-net, the Attention Gate Mechanism and the Residual Neural Network). Public breast ultrasound images dataset of Baheya hospital in Egypt is used in this work. Dice coefficient, Jaccard index and Accuracy are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed model on the test set. Attention residual u-net can significantly give a dice coefficient = 90%, Jaccard index = 76% and Accuracy = 90%. The proposed model is compared with two other breast segmentation methods on the same dataset. The results show that the modified U-net model was able to achieve accurate segmentation of breast lesions in breast ultrasound images.\",\n",

In order to optimize the operation of a gas turbine, it is necessary to develop system identification models that allow for the development of studies and analyses to increase the system\\u2019s reliability. Current strategies for modeling complex and non-linear systems can be based on artificial intelligence techniques, using autoregressive neural networks of the NARX and LSTM type. In this context, this work aims to develop a model of a gas turbine capable of estimating the rotation speed of the turbine and simultaneously estimating the uncertainty associated with the estimation. These methodologies are based on artificial neural networks and the Monte Carlo dropout simulation method. The results were obtained from experimental data from a 215 MW gas turbine, getting the best model with a MAPE of 0.02% and an uncertainty associated with the turbine rotation speed of 2.2 RPM.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The purpose of aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is to determine the sentiment polarity of aspects in a given sentence. Most historical works on sentiment analysis used complex and inefficient methods to integrate external knowledge. Furthermore, they fell short of completely utilizing BERT\\u2019s potential because when trying to generate word embeddings, they merely averaged the BERT subword vectors. To overcome these limitations, we propose a knowledge-guided heterogeneous graph convolutional network for aspect-based sentiment analysis (KHGCN). Specifically, we consider merging subword vectors utilizing a dynamic weight mechanism in the BERT embedding layer. Additionally, heterogeneous graphs are constructed to fuse different feature associations between words, and graph convolutional networks are utilized to identify context-specific syntactic features. Furthermore, by embedding a knowledge graph, the model can learn additional features from sources other than the corpus. Based on this knowledge, it is consequently possible to obtain more knowledge representation for a particular aspect by utilizing the attention mechanism. Last but not least, semantic features, syntactic features, and knowledge are dynamically combined using feature fusion. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our model achieves accuracy rates of 80.87%, 85.42%, and 91.07%, which is an improvement of more than 2% compared to other benchmark models based on HGCNs and BERT.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The advent of digital technology has significantly influenced consumer behaviors, especially among college students. This paper delves into the phenomenon of alienation in online consumption among higher vocational students in China, a demographic particularly vulnerable to the allure of virtual retail therapy. Drawing on data collected from five vocational colleges in Jiangxi Province, the study employs a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative surveys with qualitative interviews to paint a comprehensive picture of students' consumption habits. The emergence of blind consumption, over-consumption, and a propensity for luxury items is evident, driven by a complex interplay of social pressures, emotional needs, and easy access to credit. The paper introduces an Early Warning Model (EWM), designed to detect early signs of consumption alienation and trigger timely interventions. The model integrates various data points, including consumption patterns, social influences, emotional well-being, and financial health, leveraging machine learning algorithms for predictive analytics. Real-life case studies demonstrate the EWM\\u2019s efficacy, showcasing its capacity to facilitate positive behavioral change and promote financial literacy.[1] The model not only serves as a crucial tool for educators, counselors, and parents but also lays the groundwork for policy interventions and educational programs aimed at nurturing responsible digital consumers. This research contributes to the existing body of knowledge on online consumption behaviors, providing a targeted analysis of higher vocational students and introducing an innovative solution to mitigate the risks associated with consumption alienation.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Hardware Trojans, malicious components that attempt to prevent a chip from operating as expected, are carefully crafted to circumvent detection during the predeployment silicon design and verification stages. They are an emerging threat being investigated by academia, the military, and industry. Therefore, run-time hardware Trojan detection is critically needed as the final layer of defense during chip deployment, and in this work, we focus on hardware Trojans that target the processor\\u2019s performance. Current state-of-the-art detectors watch hardware counters for anomalies using complex machine-learning models, which require a dedicated off-chip processor and must be trained extensively for each target processor. In this work, we propose a lightweight solution that uses data from a single reference run to accurately determine whether a Trojan is slowing processor performance, across CPU configurations, without the need for new profiles. To accomplish this, we use an analytical model based on the application\\u2019s inherent microarchitecturally independent characteristics. Such models determine the expected microarchitectural events across different processor configurations without requiring reference values for each application-hardware configuration pair. By comparing predicted values to actual hardware events, one can quickly check for unexpected application slowdowns that are the key signatures of many hardware Trojans. The proposed methodology achieves a higher true positive rate (TPR) compared to prior works while having no false positives. The proposed detector incurs no run-time performance penalty and only adds a negligible power overhead of 0.005%.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The marketisation of education, globalisation, and the requirement for continuous economic growth, have positioned creativity and innovation as essential components of 21st century education. Creative approaches to learning have been shown to support well-being and promote a culture of continuous improvement which in turn, support the development of prosperous and sustainable, digital economies (OECD, 2019). In terms of teacher education then, creativity and innovation are now regarded as core skills for all teachers (Henriksen et al., 2021). If these skills are seen as being fundamental to societal development, they must therefore be nurtured as a key component of professional learning for teachers. Using a mixed methods approach, this study aims to explore ways in which creative and innovative mindsets can be fostered in student teachers as part of their initial teacher education. Questionnaires and focus groups were used to collect data. Firstly, a first-year cohort of Primary and Post Primary student teachers (n= 118 ) attended an introduction to design thinking and creative problem-solving, 3-hour workshop with the objective of enhancing their creative problem-solving and innovative skills in preparation for school placement. Secondly, a collaborative podcast project with students and lecturers was developed to enhance students\\u2019 learning experiences and foster creativity. Thirdly, following their school placement, further data were collected to address the extent to which the participants implemented some of the workshop initiatives during their placement. Preliminary findings suggest that the revised approach to teaching and learning can encourage creative, critical thinking and increase student confidence as they develop their competence and practice as teachers. In addition, the data suggest that students favour the more andragogical approach employed in the workshops and podcast development as opposed to traditional, pedagogical modes of teaching and learning. The research provides a strong platform to embed a culture of critical thinking, creativity, collaboration and communication, and in doing so, establish and build collaborative partnerships between education, business and community.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Academic achievement is a critical measure of intellectual ability, prompting extensive research into cognitive tasks as potential predictors. Neuroimaging technologies, such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), offer insights into brain hemodynamics, allowing understanding of the link between cognitive performance and academic achievement. Herein, we explored the association between cognitive tasks and academic achievement by analyzing prefrontal fNIRS signals. A novel quantum annealer (QA) feature selection algorithm was applied to fNIRS data to identify cognitive tasks correlated with CSAT scores. Twelve features (signal mean, median, variance, peak, number of peaks, sum of peaks, slope, minimum, kurtosis, skewness, standard deviation, and root mean square) were extracted from fNIRS signals at two time windows (10- and 60-second) to compare results from various feature variable conditions. The feature selection results from the QA-based and XGBoost regressor algorithms were compared to validate the former's performance. In a three-step validation process using multiple linear regression models, correlation coefficients between the feature variables and the CSAT scores, model fitness (adjusted R2), and model prediction error (RMSE) values were calculated. The quantum annealer demonstrated comparable performance to classical machine learning models, and specific cognitive tasks, including verbal fluency, recognition, and the Corsi block tapping task, were correlated with academic achievement. Group analyses revealed stronger associations between Tower of London and N-back tasks with higher CSAT scores. Quantum annealing algorithms have significant potential in feature selection using fNIRS data, and represents a novel research approach. Future studies should explore predictors of academic achievement and cognitive ability.\",\n",

To fill this gap, we propose the Machine Learning Control Method (MLCM), a new approach for causal panel analysis based on counterfactual forecasting with machine learning. The MLCM estimates policy-relevant causal parameters in short- and long-panel settings without relying on untreated units. We formalize identification in the potential outcomes framework and then provide estimation based on supervised machine learning algorithms. To illustrate the advantages of our estimator, we present simulation evidence and an empirical application on the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on educational inequality in Italy.

However, existing methods for predicting antibiotic resistance from genomic sequence data have had lim- ited success due to their inability to model epistatic effects and generalize to novel variants. Here, we present GeneBac, a deep learning method for predicting antibiotic resistance from DNA sequence through the integration of interactions between genes. We apply GeneBac to two distinct bacterial species and show that it can successfully predict the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of multiple antibiotics. We use the WHO Mycobacterium tuberculosis mutation cat- alogue to demonstrate that GeneBac accurately predicts the effects of different variants, including novel variants that have not been observed during training. GeneBac is a modular framework which can be applied to a number of tasks including gene expression prediction, resistant gene identification and strain clus- tering. We leverage this modularity to transfer learn from the transcriptomic data to improve performance on the MIC prediction task.\",\n",

CPRP is usually formulated into a link-prediction task on a relationship graph of concepts and solved by training the graph neural network (GNN) model. However, current directed GNNs fail to manage graph isomorphism which refers to the invariance of non-isomorphic graphs, reducing the expressivity of resulting representations. We present a permutation-equivariant directed GNN model by introducing the Weisfeiler-Lehman test into directed GNN learning. Our method is then used for CPRP and evaluated on three public datasets. The experimental results show that our model delivers better prediction performance than the state-of-the-art methods.\",\n",

Most patients with pancreatic cancer do not show symptoms until the disease has reached an advanced stage. The high mortality of pancreatic cancer is mainly due to fact that more than 50% of patients already discover it with metastasis, which reduces treatment options and chances of cure. The success of treatment depends on discovering disease as early as possible. Diagnosis in pancreatic cancer is traditionally confirmed by tissue biopsy of organ. This work presents a methodology to aid the diagnosis based on hyperspectral image for carcinogenic tissue classification using partial least squares and discriminant analysis to optimize process of diagnosing pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The results showed overlapping of areas classified by proposed model and by images used for diagnosis, proving to be a potential tool to aid in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Given the development of artificial intelligence (AI) and the conditions of vulnerability of large sectors of the population, the question emerges: what are the ethical limits of technologies in patient care? This paper examines this question in the light of the \\u201clanguage of nature\\u201d and of Aristotelian causal analysis, in particular the concept of means and ends. Thus, it is possible to point out the root of the distinction between the identity of the person and the entity of any technology. Nature indicates that the person is always an end in itself. Technology, on the contrary, should only be a means to serve the person. The diversity of their respective natures also explains why their respective agencies enjoy diverse scopes. Technological operations (artificial agency, artificial intelligence) find their meaning in the results obtained through them (poiesis). Moreover, the person is capable of actions whose purpose is precisely the action itself (praxis), in which personal agency and, ultimately, the person themselves, is irreplaceable. Forgetting the distinction between what, by nature, is an end and what can only be a means is equivalent to losing sight of the instrumental nature of AI and, therefore, its specific meaning: the greatest good of the patient. It is concluded that the language of nature serves as a filter that supports the effective subordination of the use of AI to its specific purpose, the human good. The greatest contribution of this work is to draw attention to the nature of the person and technology, and about their respective agencies. In other words: listening to the language of nature, and attending to the diverse nature of the person and technology, personal agency, and artificial agency.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Introduction Psychiatric comorbidities have a significant impact on the course of illness in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. To accurately predict outcomes for individual patients using computerized prognostic models, it is essential to consider these comorbidities and their influence. Methods In our study, we utilized a multi-modal deep learning architecture to forecast symptomatic remission, focusing on a multicenter sample of patients with first-episode psychosis from the OPTiMiSE study. Additionally, we introduced a counterfactual model explanation technique to examine how scores on the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) affected the likelihood of remission, both at the group level and for individual patients. Results Our findings at the group level revealed that most comorbidities had a negative association with remission. Among them, current and recurrent depressive disorders consistently exerted the greatest negative impact on the probability of remission across patients. However, we made an interesting observation: current suicidality within the past month and substance abuse within the past 12\\u2009months were associated with an increased chance of remission in patients. We found a high degree of variability among patients at the individual level. Through hierarchical clustering analysis, we identified two subgroups: one in which comorbidities had a relatively limited effect on remission (approximately 45% of patients), and another in which comorbidities more strongly influenced remission. By incorporating comorbidities into individualized prognostic prediction models, we determined which specific comorbidities had the greatest impact on remission at both the group level and for individual patients. Discussion These results highlight the importance of identifying and including relevant comorbidities in prediction models, providing valuable insights for improving the treatment and prognosis of patients with psychotic disorders. Furthermore, they open avenues for further research into the efficacy of treating these comorbidities to enhance overall patient outcomes.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Water transit time is the duration between the entry and exit of a parcel of water across a hydrologic system. It is a fundamental characteristic that links hydrologic transport, biogeochemical processing, and water quality, and it has broad implications for resource vulnerability and sustainability. Physically based models can accurately describe transit time distributions but require significant computational resources when applied to large regions at high resolutions. In this study, we evaluate the potential of machine learning metamodels to emulate physically based models for computationally efficient prediction of key metrics from transit time distributions. Transit times are computed from a continental scale, integrated hydrologic model coupled with particle tracking. The metamodeling approach is illustrated in the 280,000-sq km Upper Colorado River Basin, USA, a principal headwater basin that is under multiple stresses, including resource overallocation, water quality threats, and climate change impacts. We evaluate the effects of using different types of spatial aggregation in the metamodels, including regular grids, hydrologic units, and upstream watersheds. We found that metamodels using upstream watershed aggregation exhibited the best overall performance across our target predictions. Errors were more pronounced in metamodels that employed smaller spatial aggregation units compared to larger units, suggesting that additional predictors that capture the heterogeneity of topographic, climatic, and geologic properties are needed at these scales. We also found that predictor importance and input-output relations were remarkably consistent across spatial aggregation type and agree with previous findings documented from physically based models and tracer-based studies. Our results show the feasibility of developing machine learning metamodels for predicting transit times and demonstrate the necessity of multiscale analyses to probe the robustness of the findings.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"\\n Large-scale coupled reservoir-geomechanical simulation is becoming a necessity for an in-depth assessment of subsurface energy developments such as hydrocarbon recovery and geological carbon storage, while a robust and efficient upscaling technique for the geomechanical constitutive behavior of heterogeneous reservoir is still missing to push forward the application of time-consuming coupled reservoir-geomechanical simulation. Here, we focus on the impact of lithological heterogeneity on the shear strength and stress-strain behavior and propose a deep learning-based upscaling technique that can provide the upscaled shear strength and stress-strain behavior from facies models and geomechanical parameters. The objectives of the proposed upscaling technique lie in the following two aspects: 1) bridge the gap between the fine-scale geological models and computationally efficient reservoir-geomechanical models used for large-scale subsurface energy development; 2) provide the upscaled realizations needed for geomechanical assessments considering geological uncertainties. The first step of the deep learning-based upscaling technique is generating a dataset that contains a sufficient number of data samples. Each sample consists of a randomly generated spatial correlated sand-shale realization (input) and the computed macroscopic shear strength and stress-strain behavior via finite element simulations (outputs). Using the assembled dataset, convolutional neural network (CNN) models are trained to build proxy models as an alternative for numerical upscaling. The trained CNN models can provide the upscaled shear strength (R2 > 0.95) and stress-strain behavior (R2 > 0.93) that highly agree with that from the computationally extensive numerical upscaling method in a much shorter time frame. The proposed deep learning-based upscaling technique can promote the application of large-scale reservoir-geomechanical simulation for geomechanical assessment and quantify the impact of geological uncertainties by conducting coupled simulations on a variety of reservoir realizations.\",\n",

However, interference may severely affect the aggregation process. In this work, we propose an analog product code and present a low complexity Bayesian decoder for analog error correction in IoT-AirComp in the presence of burst sparse impulsive interference. We model the burst interference using a Markov model and cancel it via streaming variational message passing based Bayesian inference algorithm. The Bayesian approach allows us to learn global parameters directly via measurements in a streaming fashion, thus facilitating online machine learning. We provide extensive simulations to verify the model and show improved performance against small as well as burst sparse impulsive interference.\",\n",

Firstly, in the feature extraction stage, a PST attention module is embedded to suppress redundant interfering feature information; The guidance network grasps effective features for learning during the training process. Secondly, a feature fusion module with a bilateral structure is used in the feature fusion process, making full use of contextual semantic information to improve the accuracy of small-scale target detection. The experimental results show that the average accuracy of the improved YOLOv5 algorithm is 81.82%, which is 4.71 percentage points higher than YOLOv5s algorithm and 1.2 percentage points higher than YOLOX-S. This indicates that the improved YOLOv5s network model used in this paper has good results in the detection of insulator defects and has certain application value in actual power inspection tasks.\",\n",

      "      \"title\": \"B3X: a novel efficient algorithm for accurate automated auscultatory blood pressure estimation\",\n",
      "      \"abstract\": \"Objective. The auscultatory technique is still considered the most accurate method for non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) measurement, although its reliability depends on operator\\u2019s skills. Various methods for automated Korotkoff sounds analysis have been proposed for reliable estimation of systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressures. To this aim, very complex methodologies have been presented, including some based on artificial intelligence (AI). This study proposes a relatively simple methodology, named B3X, to estimate SBP and DBP by processing Korotkoff sounds recordings acquired during an auscultatory NIBP measurement. Approach. The beat-by-beat change in morphology of adjacent Korotkoff sounds is evaluated via their cross-correlation. The time series of the beat-by-beat cross-correlation and its first derivative are analyzed to locate the timings of SBP and DBP values. Extensive tests were performed on a public database of 350 annotated measurements, and the performance was evaluated according to the BHS, AAMI/ANSI, and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) quality standards. Main results. The proposed approach achieved \\u2018A\\u2019 scores for SBP and DBP in the BHS grading system, and passed the quality tests of AAMI/ANSI and ISO standards. The B3X algorithm outperformed two well-established algorithms for oscillometric NIBP measurement in both SBP and DBP estimation. It also outperformed four AI-based algorithms in DBP estimation, while providing comparable performance for SBP, at the cost of a much lower computational burden. The full code of the B3X algorithm is provided in a public repository. Significance. The very good performances ensured by the proposed B3X algorithm, at a low computational cost and without the need for parameter training, support its direct implementation into clinical blood pressure (BP) monitoring devices. The results of this study pave the way for solving/overcoming the trade-off between the accuracy of the auscultatory technique and the objectivity of oscillatory measurements, by bringing an automated auscultatory BP measurement method in clinical practice.\",\n",

WebP is a long-known, but not very poplar file format that provides lossy or lossless compression of data, in the form of a still image or an animation. A great number of WebP features are optional, so the structure of the image offers great opportunities for data hiding. The article describes distinct approaches to steganography divided into two categories: format-based and data-based. Among format-based methods, we name simple injection, multi-secret steganography that uses thumbnails, hiding a message in metadata or in a specific data chunk. Data-based methods achieve secret concealment with the use of a transparent, WebP-specific algorithm that embeds bits by choosing proper prediction modes and alteration of the color indexing transform. The capacity of presented techniques varies. It may be unlimited for injection, up to a few hundred megabytes for other format-based algorithms, or be content-dependent in data-based techniques. These methods fit into the container modification branch of steganography. We also present a container selection technique which benefits from available WebP compression parameters. Images generated with the described methods were tested with three applications, including the Firefox web browser, GNU Image Manipulation Program, and ImageMagick. Some of the presented techniques can be combined in order to conceal more than one message in a single carrier.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Cancer is a heterogeneous disease, and patients with tumors from different organs can share similar epigenetic and genetic alterations. Therefore, it is crucial to identify the novel subgroups of patients with similar molecular characteristics. It is possible to propose a better treatment strategy when the heterogeneity of the patient is accounted for during subgroup identification, irrespective of the tissue of origin. This work proposes a machine learning (ML) based pipeline for subgroup identification in pan-cancer. Here, mRNA, miRNA, DNA methylation, and protein expression features from pan-cancer samples were concatenated and non-linearly projected to a lower dimension using an ML algorithm. This data was then clustered to identify multi-omics-based novel subgroups. The clinical characterization of these ML subgroups indicated significant differences in overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) (p-value<0.0001). The subgroups formed by the patients from different tumors shared similar molecular alterations in terms of immune microenvironment, mutation profile, and enriched pathways. Further, decision-level and feature-level fused classification models were built to identify the novel subgroups for unseen samples. Additionally, the classification models were used to obtain the class labels for the validation samples, and the molecular characteristics were verified. To summarize, this work identified novel ML subgroups using multi-omics data and showed that the patients with different tumor types could be similar molecularly. We also proposed and validated the classification models for subgroup identification. The proposed classification models can be used to identify the novel multi-omics subgroups, and the molecular characteristics of each subgroup can be used to design appropriate treatment regimen.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Multipliers are widely-used arithmetic operators in digital signal processing and machine learning circuits. Due to their relatively high complexity, they can have high latency and be a significant source of power consumption. One strategy to alleviate these limitations is to use approximate computing. This paper thus introduces an original FPGA-based approximate multiplier specifically optimized for machine learning computations. It utilizes dynamically reconfigurable lookup table (LUT) primitives in AMD-Xilinx technology to realize the core part of the computations. The paper provides an in-depth analysis of the hardware architecture, implementation outcomes, and accuracy evaluations of the multiplier proposed in INT8 precision. Implementation results on an AMD-Xilinx Kintex Ultrascale+ FPGA demonstrate remarkable savings of 64% and 67% in LUT utilization for signed multiplication and multiply-and-accumulation configurations, respectively, when compared to the standard Xilinx multiplier core. Accuracy measurements on four popular deep learning (DL) benchmarks indicate a minimal average accuracy decrease of less than 0.29% during post-training deployment, with the maximum reduction staying less than 0.33%.

      "      \"abstract\": \"Evidence from clinical and experimental investigations reveals the role of AKT in oral cancer, which has led to the development of therapeutic and pharmacological medications for inhibiting AKT protein. Despite prodigious effort, researchers are searching for new allosteric inhibitors as orthosteric inhibitors are non-selective and exert off-target effects. In the current study, we proposed an integrated computational workflow for identifying allosteric AKT1 inhibitors as this isoform is highly correlated with poor prognosis and survival. To achieve this objective, 84 classification QSAR models with six different machine learning algorithms were developed. The models created with RDKit_RF and RDKit_kstar outperformed internal and test set validation with an ROC of 0.98. The outperformed models were then used to screen Chembl, which contains over a million compounds, for AKT1 inhibitors. The Tanimoto similarity search approach identified the compounds structurally resembling AKT allosteric inhibitors. The filtered compounds were further subjected to docking phases, molecular dynamic simulation and mmpbsa to verify the binding mode of selected ones. All these analyses suggested hit 5 (CHEMBL3948083) as the potential allosteric inhibitor of AKT1 as the stability parameters, favourable binding affinity (-107.78\\u2009\\u00b1\\u200911.56\\u2009KJ/mol) and ligand interaction were better in comparison to other compounds and reference compound. The residual analysis demonstrated that allosteric and isoform-specific residues such as Trp80 and Val270 contributed the larger energy for ligand binding. The proposed integrated approach in this study might achieve a futuristic outcome when employed in a pharmaceutical scheme different from the conventional method.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Recent theoretical and experimental results have suggested that they are ideal systems for exploiting the valley degrees of freedom of Bloch electrons. Here, we report detailed studies of the opto-valleytronic properties of a chiral histidine molecule embedded in monolayer MoS2 single crystals grown via chemical vapor deposition. By irradiating MoS2 with circularly polarized light and measuring the resulting spatially resolved circularly polarized emission, we find the existence of a significantly increased circular polarization for D-histidine doped MoS2. The increased valley contrast is attributed to the selective enhancement of both the excitation and emission rates having one particular handedness of the circular polarization. These results provide a promising pathway to enhance the valley contrast for monolayer TMDCs at room temperature.\",\n",

This objective quantizes responses into spike counts within a fixed summation interval, typically on the order of 10 to 100 milliseconds in duration; however, neuronal responses are often time accurate down to a few milliseconds, and at these timescales, Poisson models typically perform poorly. To overcome this limitation, we propose the concept of a spike distance function that maps points in time to the temporal distance to the nearest spike. We show that neural networks can be trained to approximate spike distance functions, and we present an efficient algorithm for inferring spike trains from the outputs of these models. Using recordings of chicken and frog retinal ganglion cells responding to visual stimuli, we compare the performance of our approach to Poisson models trained with various summation intervals. We show that our approach outperforms the standard Poisson approach at spike train inference.\",\n",

The spatiotemporal Knowledge Graph can uniformly represent and efficiently organize entities containing spatial location information and temporal information. Battlefield situational objectives and their relationships can be abstracted as a triple composed of two specific types of spatiotemporal entities and combat intent relationships. Using typical confrontation scene data to train neural networks, and fusing the confidence levels of the entity and Knowledge Graph, the confidence level evaluation results of the intent triple for the existing spatiotemporal knowledge base are calculated. The simulation test results show that the method can effectively evaluate the confidence level of the intent recognition results, and the accuracy rate is improved compared with the current mainstream methods. This method breaks the \\\"closure\\\" assumption of the Knowledge Graph update and completion algorithm from the algorithm idea level, and completes the last link in the popularization and application of the intent recognition method\",\n",

Random error is the major determinant of the measurement accuracy of the gyrowheel. However, large tilt angles and de-tuned spin speeds of the gyrowheel rotor result in special characteristics of its random error, which brings challenges of extracting and modeling the random error. To overcome the challenges, a random error extraction method is proposed by adopting the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) technique.

      "      \"abstract\": \"The cold-start problem is a major factor that limits the effectiveness of recommendation systems. Having too few available interaction records brings a series of challenges when predicting user preferences. At present, there are two main kinds of strategies for solving this problem from different perspectives. One is cross-domain recommendation (CDR), which introduces additional information by domain knowledge propagation with transfer learning. However, CDR methods follow traditional training processes in machine learning and cannot solve this typical few-shot problem from the perspective of optimization. The other type of methods that has recently emerged is based on meta-learning. Most of these approaches focus only on generating a meta-model to perform better on new tasks and ignore improvements based on cross-domain information. Therefore, it is necessary to design a novel approach to solve this problem with both domain knowledge and meta-optimization. To achieve this goal, a novel cross-domain meta-learner for cold-start recommendation (MetaCDR) is proposed. In MetaCDR, we design a domain knowledge meta-transfer module to connect different domain networks. In addition, we introduce a pretraining strategy to ensure its efficiency. The experimental results show that MetaCDR performs significantly better than state-of-the-art models in a variety of scenarios.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"1559 Background: Though smoking is a major risk factor for lung cancer, it has been a challenge to collect patients\\u2019 smoking history information accurately from the EH due to data inconsistency and incompleteness. To address these challenges, we utilized a weak supervision methodology to automatically annotate smoking status of patients with lung cancer and correlated it with tumor characteristics. Methods: We analyzed 6,355 patients with lung cancer who underwent tumor profiling with MSK-IMPACT. In total, 14,555 unstructured clinical notes were extracted from EHR at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. The weak supervision methodology used a generative model for intermediate labels that were subsequently tuned by machine-learning classifier to generate the final labels. Clinical notes from a randomly sampled set of 564 patients were manually curated and used for performance assessment. The rest of the patients were split into training and validation datasets used for model training and hyperparameter tuning. Pack years were also extracted from clinical notes using Natural Language Processing. We next conducted multivariate analyses for primary and metastatic tumor samples separately to correlate smoking metrics with tumor characteristics including tumor mutation burden (TMB) and chromosomal instability, as inferred by the fraction of genome altered (FGA) after controlling for age at sequencing, gender, histological subtypes, ancestry, coverage and tumor purity. Results: The weak supervision classifier had almost perfect performance for 2-label classification model (ever smokers and never smokers) with macro F1-score: 97.7%, balanced accuracy: 97.1%, 97.1%, precision:98.4%, 98.4% and recall: 99.5%,94.6% respectively. For 3-label classification model (never smoker, former smoker, and current smoker), the macro F1-score was 79.8%; balanced accuracy: 97.1%, 86.7%, 71.2%, precision: 93.9%, 90.1%, 61.7%, recall: 96.1%, 93.3%, 46.0% respectively. Analyzing genomic data, we observed that smoking status (smoker vs. never smoker) and pack-years were associated with TMB in both primary and metastatic tumor samples (p<2e-16). FGA was marginally associated with smokers compared to never smokers in primary tumor samples (p=0.06). Among smokers diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma, significantly high FGA in primary tumor samples was observed in males compared to females after adjusting for pack-years and other variables (p= 3.3e-3). Conclusions: We demonstrated high performance of our approach for automated curation of smoking history from EHR. The genomic results confirmed distinct mutational patterns associated with smoking behavior in patients with lung cancer. We are currently exploring multimodal approaches by including chest CT images and \\u201ctime of quitting\\u201d to improve performance of the 3-class model.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Quantum computing is finding promising applications in optimization, machine learning and physics, leading to the development of various models for representing quantum information. Because these representations are often studied in different contexts (many-body physics, machine learning, formal verification, simulation), little is known about fundamental trade-offs between their succinctness and the runtime of operations to update them. We therefore analytically investigate three widely-used quantum state representations: matrix product states (MPS), decision diagrams (DDs), and restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs). We map the relative succinctness of these data structures and provide the complexity for relevant query and manipulation operations. Further, to chart the balance between succinctness and operation efficiency, we extend the concept of rapidity with support for the non-canonical data structures studied in this work, showing in particular that MPS is at least as rapid as some DDs. By providing a knowledge compilation map for quantum state representations, this paper contributes to the understanding of the inherent time and space efficiency trade-offs in this area.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Deep Kernel Learning (DKL) combines the representational power of neural networks with the uncertainty quantification of Gaussian Processes. Hence, it is potentially a promising tool to learn and control complex dynamical systems. In this letter, we develop a scalable abstraction-based framework that enables the use of DKL for control synthesis of stochastic dynamical systems against complex specifications. Specifically, we consider temporal logic specifications and create an end-to-end framework that uses DKL to learn an unknown system from data and formally abstracts the DKL model into an interval Markov decision process to perform control synthesis with correctness guarantees. Furthermore, we identify a deep architecture that enables accurate learning and efficient abstraction computation. The effectiveness of our approach is illustrated on various benchmarks, including a 5-D nonlinear stochastic system, showing how control synthesis with DKL can substantially outperform state-of-the-art competitive methods.\",\n",

One of the most popular topics in this field is Neuroevolution, since is combines the advantages of evolutionary algorithms with the advantages of neural and deep neural networks. In this paper, we demonstrate how can NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) be used for game playing. The agent that we trained was able to rapidly learn how to play 2 very popular games, namely Dinosaur Game and Flappy Bird, without the need of any specialized computational device (no GPUs were needed). Multiple experiments were conducted, for different scenarios, showing how changing the game environment can change the learning performance of the algorithm.\",\n",

In this paper, we define recommendation indicators based on the results of analyzing big data collected from real-time education platform. Also we propose a recommendation system providing classes fitting into students based on the recommendation indicators using machine learning. By providing a student-centered recommendation service, this platform can eventually maximize not only learning synergy but also learning achievements for students.\",\n",

Although the previous point cloud analysis networks based on multi-layer perceptions (MLPs) exhibit a simple structure, they fail to consider semantic information among different tokens by exploiting fully connected layers with fixed weights for token aggregation. To address this limitation, we draw inspiration from the Wave-MLP architecture in the 2D image field and introduce the concept of phase-aware token mixing into 3D point cloud processing, aiming to dynamically adjust the relationship between tokens and the fixed weights. In this paper, we propose a novel point cloud analysis network called PointWave-MLP. Experimental results demonstrate that PointWave-MLP achieves significant improvements in point cloud classification and segmentation tasks, outperforming some CNN-based and Transformer-based methods.\",\n",

Generative AI APIs can be consumed by mobile devices, which are constrained by resources such as CPU, memory, and battery power. Power can be saved by using both Edge and Cloud Computing. However, there is a penalty to response time implementing these services. There seems to be a greater impact on response time with Cloud Computing than with Edge Computing, however Edge Computing is constrained by limits on payload and maximum response times. Our testing results show that Edge Computing is a good middle ground, providing a balance between savings in CPU time, while somewhat mitigating the penalty in response time. Developers exploring the option to use Cloud and/or Edge Computing for power savings on mobile devices should consider the size of their data sets carefully to determine if an Edge Computing service is a viable option.\",\n",

In this article, the coatings are described as being composed of non-stoichiometric polycomplexes, products of electrostatic coupling of two commercial biodegradable ionic polymers, anionic sodium alginate and cationic quaternized hydroxyethyl cellulose ethoxylate. Non-stoichiometric polycomplexes with a 5-fold excess of the cationic polymer were used for immobilizing hydrophobic biocidal 4-hexylresorcinol (HR). Being dispersed in water, the polycomplex particles were capable of absorbing a tenfold excess of HR in relation to the polycation. After deposition onto the plastic surface and drying, the aqueous polycomplex\\u2013HR composite formulation forms a transparent homogeneous coating, which swells slightly in water. The interpolyelectrolyte complex (IPEC) is substantially non-toxic. The incorporation of HR in the IPEC imparts antimicrobial activity to the resulting composite, in both aqueous solutions and coatings, against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and yeast. The polysaccharide-based polycomplexes with embedded HR are promising for the fabrication of biocidal films and coatings.\",\n",

In this paper, we propose a deep ensemble model for semantic segmentation of indoor scenes. Our ensemble model combines three distinct deep learning models to enhance both diversity and accuracy. Additionally, we customize YOLOv8 for instance-level segmentation of indoor environments. A comprehensive set of experiments on the publicly available data set demonstrates that our model achieves the highest IoU compared to state-of-the-art deep learning models.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Principal component analysis (PCA) based on L1-norm has drawn growing interest in recent years. It is especially popular in the machine learning and pattern recognition communities for its robustness to outliers. Although optimal algorithms for L1-norm maximization exist, they have very high computational complexity and can be used for evaluation purposes only. In practice, only approximate techniques have been considered so far. Currently, the most popular method is the bit-flipping technique, where the L1-norm maximization is viewed as a combinatorial problem over the binary field. Recently, we proposed exhaustive, but faster algorithm [1] based on two-dimensional Jacobi rotations that also offer high accuracy. In this paper, we develop a novel variant of this method that uses three-dimensional rotations and quaternion algebra. Our experiments show that the proposed approach offers higher accuracy than other approximate algorithms, but at the expense of the additional computational cost. However, for large datasets, the cost is still lower than that of the bit-flipping technique.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Text-to-image generation is a significant domain in modern computer vision and has achieved substantial improvements through the evolution of generative architectures. Among these, there are diffusion-based models that have demonstrated essential quality enhancements. These models are generally split into two categories: pixel-level and latent-level approaches. We present Kandinsky1, a novel exploration of latent diffusion architecture, combining the principles of the image prior models with latent diffusion techniques. The image prior model is trained separately to map text embeddings to image embeddings of CLIP. Another distinct feature of the proposed model is the modified MoVQ implementation, which serves as the image autoencoder component. Overall, the designed model contains 3.3B parameters. We also deployed a user-friendly demo system that supports diverse generative modes such as text-to-image generation, image fusion, text and image fusion, image variations generation, and text-guided inpainting/outpainting. Additionally, we released the source code and checkpoints for the Kandinsky models. Experimental evaluations demonstrate a FID score of 8.03 on the COCO-30K dataset, marking our model as the top open-source performer in terms of measurable image generation quality.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Acoustic feedback arises from the leakage of sound from the loudspeaker back to the microphone and is a common problem in hearing aids and public address systems. One popular solution to this problem is adaptive feedback cancellation (AFC) which utilizes an adaptive filter (AF) to estimate and subsequently subtract the feedback component from the microphone. Due to the closed-loop system the loudspeaker signal and the incoming signal exhibit a high correlation. However, model-based and more recently learning-based AF methods typically neglect this correlation in their derivation, leading to sub-optimal performance in closed-loop scenarios. In this paper, we propose Neural-AFC, a recurrent neural network (RNN) designed for AFC step-size control optimization, that addresses this problem by including not only the adaptive filter but also the acoustic feedback path and the system gain in the recurrence model. Our experiment results show that when trained within this closed-loop model, Neural-AFC improves the steady-state performance and (re)convergence rate compared to conventional and open-loop RNN-based AF in both hearing aid and public address system applications.\",\n",

Method The outcome was postoperative severe hypernatremia. We identified risk factors associated with hypernatremia using multivariable regression. We trained machine learning models to predict the outcome. We compared serum sodium change, intravenous input, oral input, total input, urine output, and net fluid balance according to different nurse shifts. Results Among 234 included patients, 125 developed severe hypernatremia after surgery. The peak incidence occurred during day 0 and day 6 after surgery. The risk was increased in patients with gross total resection (odds ratio (OR) 2.41, P < 0.001), high Puget classification (OR 4.44, P\\u2009=\\u20090.026), preoperative adrenal insufficiency (OR 2.01, P\\u2009=\\u20090.040), and preoperative hypernatremia (OR 5.55, P < 0.001). The random forest algorithm had the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.770, 95% CI, 0.727\\u20130.813) in predicting the outcome and was validated in the prospective validation cohort. Overnight shifts were associated with the highest serum sodium increase (P\\u2009=\\u20090.010), less intravenous input (P < 0.001), and less desmopressin use (P < 0.001). Conclusion The overall incidence of severe hypernatremia after surgical resection of craniopharyngioma was significant, especially in patients with gross total resection, hypothalamus distortion, preoperative adrenal insufficiency, and preoperative severe hypernatremia. Less intravenous input and less desmopressin use were associated with serum sodium increases, especially during overnight shifts.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Machine learning models that embed graphs in non-Euclidean spaces have shown substantial benefits in a variety of contexts, but their application has not been studied extensively in the biological domain, particularly with respect to biological pathway graphs. Such graphs exhibit a variety of complex network structures, presenting challenges to existing embedding approaches. Learning high-quality embeddings for biological pathway graphs is important for researchers looking to understand the underpinnings of disease and train high-quality predictive models on these networks. In this work, we investigate the effects of embedding pathway graphs in non-Euclidean mixed-curvature spaces and compare against traditional Euclidean graph representation learning models. We then train a supervised model using the learned node embeddings to predict missing protein-protein interactions in pathway graphs. We find large reductions in distortion and boosts on in-distribution edge prediction performance as a result of using mixed-curvature embeddings and their corresponding graph neural network models. However, we find that mixed-curvature representations underperform existing baselines on out-of-distribution edge prediction performance suggesting that these representations may overfit to the training graph topology. We provide our mixed-curvature product GCN code at https://github.com/mcneela/Mixed-Curvature-GCN and our pathway analysis code at https://github.com/mcneela/Mixed-Curvature-Pathways.\",\n",

      "      \"title\": \"Dynamic Link Prediction for New Nodes in Temporal Graph Networks\",\n",
      "      \"abstract\": \"Modelling temporal networks for dynamic link prediction of new nodes has many real-world applications, such as providing relevant item recommendations to new customers in recommender systems and suggesting appropriate posts to new users on social platforms. Unlike old nodes, new nodes have few historical links, which poses a challenge for the dynamic link prediction task. Most existing dynamic models treat all nodes equally and are not specialized for new nodes, resulting in suboptimal performances. In this paper, we consider dynamic link prediction of new nodes as a few-shot problem and propose a novel model based on the meta-learning principle to effectively mitigate this problem. Specifically, we develop a temporal encoder with a node-level span memory to obtain a new node embedding, and then we use a predictor to determine whether the new node generates a link. To overcome the few-shot challenge, we incorporate the encoder-predictor into the meta-learning paradigm, which can learn two types of implicit information during the formation of the temporal network through span adaptation and node adaptation. The acquired implicit information can serve as model initialisation and facilitate rapid adaptation to new nodes through a fine-tuning process on just a few links. Experiments on three publicly available datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our model compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"As a research hotspot across logistics, operations research, and artificial intelligence, route planning has become a key technology for intelligent transportation systems. Recently, data-driven machine learning heuristics, including learning construction methods and learning improvement methods, have achieved remarkable success in solving single-objective route planning problems. However, many practical route planning scenarios must simultaneously consider multiple conflict objectives. For example, modern logistics companies often need to simultaneously minimize time budget, transportation cost, and vehicle pollution. Several learning construction methods are proposed for solving classical multi-objective route planning (MORP) problems, yet no learning improvement heuristics have been developed so far, even though they are acknowledged to be more efficient in narrowing the optimality gap. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a learning improvement MORP method, Pareto Improver (PI). PI employs a population-based mechanism to approximate the Pareto front with a single deep reinforcement learning model. The experimental results on various MORP problems show that PI can significantly outperform other state-of-the-art methods.\",\n",

Many people have tried to answer the question: what is artificial intelligence? The difficulties of finding a definition for this term are (mainly) twofold: first, that one does not really know what natural intelligence is; then, that those who try to formulate a definition are complexed by the achievements - far from justifying such a pompous name - of this field of computer science. Although it appeared more than half a century ago as an academic discipline, artificial intelligence (AI) has seen an unprecedented development in the last few years. The increase in computing power of computers and the accumulation of huge amounts of data have allowed the ever-faster progress of automatic learning and determined its penetration into different fields, from economics and medicine to business and everyday life.\",\n",

Drop-off periods remained a time of negative emotionality for the first month of ECEC. Over time more positive emotional experiences were evident, with peer interactions fostering positive affect, activeness and involvement, while one-on-one interactions with teachers were an important context for interpersonal engagement and well-being. These findings shed light on the highly charged emotional experience for infants when they transition to institutional care, and how these might be ameliorated in practice.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"INTRODUCTION\\nThe benefits of physical activity during pregnancy and after childbirth are well established, yet many health care professionals do not feel well equipped to provide physical activity guidance to these populations. As such, the objectives of this study were to explore the immediate and longer term effects of training on health care professionals' ability to provide physical activity guidance to pregnant women and new mothers (mums).\\n\\n\\nMETHODS\\nMidwives and health visitors from 5 locations in the United Kingdom were provided with training on the Chief Medical Officers' physical activity guidelines for pregnancy and after childbirth (n = 393). Midwives and health visitors attended training to become This Mum Moves Ambassadors, then disseminated education to colleagues through a cascade training model. Changes in knowledge, confidence, and professional practice were assessed by survey before and immediately after training (n = 247), and follow-up surveys were completed 3 (n = 35) and 6 (n = 34) months posttraining.\\n\\n\\nRESULTS\\nAt all posttraining time points, health care professionals reported a significant increase in their confidence to communicate about physical activity (P < .001). The reported frequency of having conversations about physical activity increased significantly 3 and 6 months following training compared with baseline (pregnant women, P = .017; new mums, P = .005). There were changes in the types of advice and resources offered by health care professionals and an overall increase in health care professionals' own reported physical activity levels.\\n\\n\\nDISCUSSION\\nThe This Mum Moves cascade approach to delivering training in physical activity guidelines improved reported knowledge, confidence and professional practice of midwives and health visitors, both immediately following and 3 and 6 months after training.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The aim of this paper is to identify profiles of young Colombian entrepreneurs based on data from the \\u201cYouth Entrepreneurship\\u201d survey developed by the Colombian Youth Secretariat. Our research results show five profiles of entrepreneurs, mainly differentiated by age and entrepreneurial motives, as well as the identification of relevant skills, capacities, and capabilities for entrepreneurship, such as creativity, learning, and leadership. The sample consists of 633 young people aged between 14 and 28 years in Medell\\u00edn. The data treatment was approached through cluster analysis using the K-means algorithm to obtain information about the underlying nature and structure of the data. These data analysis techniques provide valuable information that can help to better understand the behaviour of Colombian entrepreneurs. They also reveal hidden information in the data. Therefore, one of the advantages of using statistical and artificial intelligence techniques in this type of study is to extract valuable information that might otherwise go unnoticed. The clusters generated show correlations with profiles that can support the design of policies in Colombia to promote an entrepreneurial ecosystem and the creation and development of new businesses through business regulation.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Catchment models are essential tools to identify and predict water quality problems linked to excessive nutrient applications (in this case phosphorus (P)). The Catchment Runoff Attenuation Flux Tool (CRAFT) has been successfully used to model nutrient fluxes and concentrations in north-western European catchments. The model is extremely parsimonious due to the relatively small number of parameters. However, an improvement to the representation of soluble P and particulate P fluxes in the fast-subsurface and surface runoff flow pathways was required. A case study in the north of Ireland applied the original and the new, enhanced (Dynamic) version of the CRAFT to the trans-border Blackwater catchment (UK and Republic of Ireland) covering nearly 1500 km2, with the land use predominantly livestock grazing. The larger size of the Blackwater also required a nested modeling approach to be implemented using a multiple sub-catchment variant (MultiCRAFT). P load reductions in the different sub-catchments were first identified using a simple approach based on the gap between the Water Framework Directive (WFD) limits for \\u201cGood\\u201d ecological status for soluble reactive P (SRP) concentrations and the recently observed concentrations. Modeling of different mitigation scenarios was then conducted using the MultiCRAFT framework with the best-performing variant of the CRAFT model embedded. The catchment was found to have flashy, episodic delivery of high concentrations of SRP and PP during runoff events which will require different sources (i.e., diffuse and point) of P to be targeted to achieve the WFD targets by the end of the decade. The modeling results thus showed that the required SRP load reductions could be best achieved using a combined scenario of mitigation measures that targeted diffuse sources contributing to both the surface runoff and fast-subsurface flow pathways, with point sources also identified as needing reduction in some sub-catchments.\",\n",

A major impediment to translating computational designs to experiments is evaluating ligands that are likely to be synthesized. Here, we provide a solution to this impediment with our ReaLigands library that contains >30,000 monodentate, bidentate (didentate), tridentate, and larger ligands cultivated by dismantling experimentally reported crystal structures. Individual ligands from mononuclear crystal structures were identified using a modified depth-first search algorithm and charge was assigned using a machine learning model based on quantum-chemical calculated features. In the library, ligands are sorted based on direct ligand-to-metal atomic connections and on denticity. Representative principal component analysis (PCA) and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) analyses were used to analyze several tridentate ligand categories, which revealed both the diversity of ligands and connections between ligand categories. We also demonstrated the utility of this library by implementing it with our building and optimization tools, which resulted in the very rapid generation of barriers for 750 bidentate ligands for Rh-hydride ethylene migratory insertion.\",\n",

      "      \"title\": \"Use of consumer wearables to monitor and predict pain in patients with sickle cell disease\",\n",
      "      \"abstract\": \"Background In sickle cell disease (SCD), unpredictable episodes of acute severe pain, known as vaso-occlusive crises (VOC), disrupt school, work activities and family life and ultimately lead to multiple hospitalizations. The ability to predict VOCs would allow a timely and adequate intervention. The first step towards this ultimate goal is to use patient-friendly and accessible technology to collect relevant data that helps infer a patient's pain experience during VOC. This study aims to: (1) determine the feasibility of remotely monitoring with a consumer wearable during hospitalization for VOC and up to 30 days after discharge, and (2) evaluate the accuracy of pain prediction using machine learning models based on physiological parameters measured by a consumer wearable. Methods Patients with SCD (\\u226518 years) who were admitted for a vaso-occlusive crisis were enrolled at a single academic center. Participants were instructed to report daily pain scores (0\\u201310) in a mobile app (Nanbar) and to continuously wear an Apple Watch up to 30 days after discharge. Data included heart rate (in rest, average and variability) and step count. Demographics, SCD genotype, and details of hospitalization including pain scores reported to nurses, were extracted from electronic medical records. Physiological data from the wearable were associated with pain scores to fit 3 different machine learning classification models. The performance of the machine learning models was evaluated using: accuracy, F1, root-mean-square error and area under the receiver-operating curve. Results Between April and June 2022, 19 patients (74% HbSS genotype) were included in this study and followed for a median time of 28 days [IQR 22\\u201334], yielding a dataset of 2,395 pain data points. Ten participants were enrolled while hospitalized for VOC. The metrics of the best performing model, the random forest model, were micro-averaged accuracy of 92%, micro-averaged F1-score of 0.63, root-mean-square error of 1.1, and area under the receiving operating characteristic curve of 0.9. Conclusion Our random forest model accurately predicts high pain scores during admission for VOC and after discharge. The Apple Watch was a feasible method to collect physiologic data and provided accuracy in prediction of pain scores.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"This letter addresses the challenge of open-set instance segmentation (OSIS) which segments both known objects and unknown objects not seen in training, and thus is essential for enabling robots to safely work in the real world. Existing solutions adopt class-agnostic segmentation where all classes share the same mask output layer leading to inferior performance. Motivated by the superiority of the class-specific mask prediction in close-set instance segmentation, we propose SemSeg with class semantics extraction and mask prediction modulation for conducting class-specific segmentation in OSIS. To extract class semantics for both known and unknown objects in the absence of supervision on unknown objects, we use contrastive learning to construct an embedding space where objects from each known class cluster in an independent territory and the complementary region of known classes can accommodate unknown objects. To modulate the mask prediction, we convert class semantic embedding to convolutional parameters used to predict the mask. Class semantics modulated OSIS allows optimizing the mask output layer for each class independently without competition between each other. And class semantic information is engaged in the segmentation process directly so that can guide and facilitate the segmentation task, which benefits unknown objects with severe generalization challenges particularly. Experiments on the COCO and GraspNet-1Billion datasets demonstrate the merits of our proposed method, especially the strength of instance segmentation for unknown objects.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The stress-strain curve of biological soft tissues helps characterize their mechanical behavior. The yield point on this curve is when a specimen breaches its elastic range due to irreversible microstructural damage. The yield point is easily found using the offset yield method in traditional engineering materials. However, correctly identifying the yield point in soft tissues can be subjective due to its nonlinear material behavior. The typical method for yield point identification is visual inspection, which is investigator-dependent and does not lend itself to automation of the analysis pipeline. An automated algorithm to identify the yield point objectively assesses soft tissues' biomechanical properties. This study aimed to analyze data from uniaxial extension testing on biological soft tissue specimens and create a generalizable machine learning model to determine a tissue sample's yield point. We present a trained machine learning model from 279 uniaxial extension curves from testing aneurysmal/nonaneurysmal and longitudinal/circumferential oriented tissue specimens that multiple experts labeled through an adjudication process. The ML model showed a median error of 5% in its estimated yield stress compared to the expert picks. The study found that an ML model could accurately identify the yield point (as defined) in various aortic tissues. Future studies will be performed to validate this approach by visually inspecting when damage occurs and adjusting the model using the generalized ML-based approach.\",\n",

Therefore, appointment scheduling (AS) system operation is used in clinics and hospitals, and its operation optimization research is of great significance. This study reviews the research progress on appointment scheduling system optimization. Firstly, we classify and conclude the existing appointment scheduling system structures and decision-making frameworks. Subsequently, we summarize the system reliability optimization framework from three aspects: appointment scheduling system optimization objectives, decision variables and constraints. Following that, we methodically review the most applied system optimization algorithms in different appointment scheduling systems. Lastly, a literature bibliometric analysis is provided. During our review of the literature, we observe that (1) optimization methods in ASs predominantly involve the application of genetic algorithms and simulation optimization algorithms; (2) neural networks and deep learning methods are core technologies in health management optimization; (3) a bibliometric analysis reveals a heightened interest in the optimization technology of ASs within China compared to other nations; and (4) further advancements are essential in the comprehensive optimization of the system, exploration of practical usage scenarios, and the application of advanced simulation and modeling techniques in this research.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Cervical spine fractures present a serious risk to the patient's health and necessitate an early and precise diagnosis for the right course of action. Deep learning techniques have recently demonstrated promising results in the analysis of medical imaging, offering a potential remedy for automated fracture detection. An innovative method for identifying cervical spine fractures using deep learning algorithms is presented in this abstract. Our suggested approach makes use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture that was trained on a sizable dataset of CT scans of the cervical spine (neck) at both the level of a single vertebrae and the entire patient. To ensure that the model can distinguish between fracture patterns and healthy anatomy, the dataset includes both normal and fractured cases. To increase the model's robustness and generalizability, preprocessing methods like image normalization and augmentation are used. To maximize its performance in fracture detection, the CNN is trained using a combination of supervised learning and transfer learning strategies. The experiments are performed on a separate test set made up of a wide variety of cervical spine fracture cases in order to assess the model's performance. The outcomes show how effective our deep learning methodology is at detecting fractures, with a high accuracy rate and a low false-negative rate. Additionally, the model performs better than conventional manual interpretation by radiologists, demonstrating its potential to support clinical judgement. Rapid and automated analysis, reduced human error, and potentially improved patient outcomes are just a few benefits of the proposed deep learning-based cervical spine fracture detection system.

      "      \"abstract\": \"\\nThis is an invited commentary on the position paper of Gruber, Block and Montemayor (2022). First, I oppose the premise in Gruber et al.\\u2019s proposal according to which there exists a \\u2018real\\u2019 and an \\u2018illusory\\u2019 time. Second, our knowledge about the universe is hypothesized, tested, and verified by the most complex physical systems known to date (brains) hence postulating the coexistence of an \\u2018absolute\\u2019 and a \\u2018real\\u2019, or an \\u2018illusory\\u2019 and a \\u2018nonillusory\\u2019 time might be unnecessary. Instead, and parsimoniously, (organic or atomic) measuring devices for duration, simultaneity, order, and so forth, have variable precision. The most exquisite clock is atomic, a good enough one for survival on Earth is at the scale of neural networks. A difference between measuring devices and brains is that the latter compute on stored temporal information. Last, I suggest additional gadgets for the Information Gathering and Utilizing Systems (IGUs) proposal. In sum, I oppose some of the theoretical premises while lending support to the idea that representing temporal statistics is a useful heuristics for some aspects of temporal cognition. From the cognitive neuroscience standpoint, IGUs are compatible with information-theoretic approaches, and with current Bayesian and predictive models implemented in neural systems, in which brains code information and compute on symbolic representations.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Steganography and secret sharing are schemes to increase the security of private information against attackers. Steganography emphasizes secrecy while secret sharing distributes the secret key in shares that are conditionally classified to reconstruct the original secret. This paper introduces a counting\\u2010based secret sharing scheme that aims to reduce the computational complexity for longer keys, thereby providing a practical steganographic approach for efficient sharing. The scheme integrates counting\\u2010based secret sharing with integer wavelet transform (IWT) and steganography. The subscriptions created using the Hamming code are embedded in the cover image. Using this method, IWT significantly reduces the occurrence of common rounding errors. As a result, secret key extraction becomes very accurate and eliminates the need to access the original images. This design, using secret sharing based on counting, not only has simplicity and efficiency, but also features such as flexibility, scalability, and lack of central authority. In addition, high\\u2010quality steganography was obtained for keys with lengths of 64, 256, 512, 1024, and 3072, showing an average PSNR=80.11 in different color images. This outstanding performance makes it a highly efficient alternative to previous designs, representing a groundbreaking contribution with significant public interest in the\\u00a0field.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Recent advancements in DL have indicated that time-domain methods are more successful than traditional time-frequency-based methods regarding speech separation. However, modeling very long sequences in time-domain separation systems presents some challenges. Recurrent neural networks and 1-D convolutional neural networks are not sufficient for modeling lengthy sequences by themselves. In this paper, a hybrid RNN is proposed, combining a pre-trained DPRNN and transformer. This strategy uses the transformer's ability to perceive context, allowing it to gain insight into the time-evolving data connected to audio signals. To handle extended input sequences, the network partitions them into more manageable sections, performing intra-section and inter-section operations iteratively. The proposed network surpasses current state-of-the-art algorithms, achieving SI-SNR of 11.129 and SDR of 11.285 dB on the public WSj0-3mix dataset.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Personalized PageRank Vectors are widely used as fundamental graph-learning tools for detecting anomalous spammers, learning graph embeddings, and training graph neural networks. The well-known local FwdPush algorithm[5] approximates PPVs and has a sublinear rate of O(1 over \\u03b1\\u03b5). A recent study [51] found that when high precision is required, FwdPush is similar to the power iteration method, and its run time is pessimistically bounded by O(m over \\u03b1 log 1 over \\u03b5). This paper looks closely at calculating PPVs for both directed and undirected graphs. By leveraging the linear invariant property, we show that FwdPush is a variant of Gauss-Seidel and propose a Successive Over-Relaxation based method, FwdPushSOR to speed it up by slightly modifying FwdPush. Additionally, we prove FwdPush has local linear convergence rate O(vol (S) over \\u03b1 log 1 over \\u03b5) enjoying advantages of two existing bounds. We also design a new local heuristic push method that reduces the number of operations by 10-50 percent compared to FwdPush. For undirected graphs, we propose two momentum-based acceleration methods that can be expressed as one-line updates and speed up non-acceleration methods by O (1 / \\u221a \\u03b1). Our experiments on six real-world graph datasets confirm the efficiency of FwdPushSOR and the acceleration methods for directed and undirected graphs, respectively.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Recently, fake news, such as low-quality news with intentionally false information, has threatened the authenticity of news information. However, existing detection methods are inefficient in modeling complicated data and leveraging external knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose a fake news detection framework based on knowledge-guided semantic analysis, which compares the news to external knowledge through triplets for fake news detection. Considering that equivalent elements of triplets may be presented in different forms, a triplet alignment method is designed to construct the bridge between news documents and knowledge graphs. Then, a dual-branch network is developed to conduct interaction and comparison between text and knowledge embeddings. Specifically, text semantics is analyzed with the guidance generated by a triplet aggregation module to capture the inconsistency between news content and external knowledge. In addition, a triplet scoring module is designed to measure rationality in view of general knowledge as a complementary clue. Finally, an interaction module is proposed to fuse rationality scores in aspects of text semantics and external knowledge to obtain detection results. Extensive experiments are conducted on publicly available datasets and several state-of-the-art methods are considered for comparison. The results verify the superiority of the proposed method in achieving more reliable detection results of fake news.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"\\n The cetane number is an important fuel property to consider for compression ignition engines as it is a measure of a fuel\\u2019s ignition delay. Derived cetane number (DCN) already varies significantly within jet fuels. With the expected increasing prevalence of alternative jet fuels, additional variability is expected. DCN is usually assigned to fuels using ASTM methods that use large equipment like the Ignition Quality Tester (IQT), which consumes a lot of fuel and is cumbersome to operate. Over the last decade, there have been advances in the development of chemometric models, which use machine learning to correlate infrared spectra of fuels to fuel properties like DCN, density, and C/H ratio, amongst many others. These techniques have certain advantages over the ASTM methods, and previous studies performed on samples of diesel fuels have shown high accuracies in DCN prediction. However, this accuracy is generally a result of high resolution, making the equipment expensive, relatively large for handheld sensors, and power-hungry. On the other hand, nondispersive infrared (NDIR) sensors, despite having a low resolution, are attractive because they can be compact, inexpensive, and power efficient. These characteristics are important for handheld or onboard fuel sensors. However, one would anticipate a trade-off between these advantages and accuracy. This study investigates this trade-off and the feasibility of low-resolution NDIR sensors to discern fuel properties such as DCN by using Machine Learning models trained on real FTIR data, and DCNs obtained from IQT. DCN predictions were made for blends of ATJ/F-24, CN fuels, and neat Jet A1, A2, and JP 5, with an error limit of 10%. It was found that there seems to be sufficient variability in the near infrared range to discern DCN with a feasible number of channels, but the channels have to be narrow (e.g. FWHMs as narrow as 60nm). For the data set in the study, the performance of linear models was better than the non-linear model. Finally, NIR region beyond 1050 nm was found to be more important in DCN prediction, primarily the regions consisting of the first and second C-H overtones and the C-H combination band.\",\n",

An autoencoder was trained on a dataset of 812\\u2009500 image/spectra pairs in argon, oxygen, Ar/O2, CF4/O2 and SF6/O2 plasmas in an industrial plasma etch tool, taken across the entire operating space of the tool. The autoencoder learns to encode the input data into a compressed latent representation and then decode it back to a reconstruction of the data. We learn to map the plasma tool\\u2019s inputs to the latent space and use the decoder to create a generative model. The model is very fast, taking just over 10\\u2009s to generate 10\\u2009000 measurements on a single GPU. This type of model can become a building block for a wide range of experiments and simulations. To aid this, we have released the underlying dataset of 812\\u2009500 image/spectra pairs used to train the model, the trained models and the model code for the community to accelerate the development and use of this exciting area of deep learning. Anyone can try the model, for free, on Google Colab.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The human gut microbiome, an intricate ecosystem housing trillions of microorganisms within the gastrointestinal tract, holds significant importance in human health and the development of diseases. Recent advances in technology have allowed for an in-depth exploration of the gut microbiome, shedding light on its composition and functions. Of particular interest is the role of diet in shaping the gut microbiome, influencing its diversity, population size, and metabolic functions. Precision nutrition, a personalized approach based on individual characteristics, has shown promise in directly impacting the composition of the gut microbiome. However, to fully understand the long-term effects of specific diets and food components on the gut microbiome and to identify the variations between individuals, longitudinal studies are crucial. Additionally, precise methods for collecting dietary data, alongside the application of machine learning techniques, hold immense potential in comprehending the gut microbiome\\u2019s response to diet and providing tailored lifestyle recommendations. In this study, we investigated the complex mechanisms that govern the diverse impacts of nutrients and specific foods on the equilibrium and functioning of the individual gut microbiome of seven volunteers (four females and three males) with an average age of 40.9 \\u00b1 10.3 years, aiming at identifying potential therapeutic targets, thus making valuable contributions to the field of personalized nutrition. These findings have the potential to revolutionize the development of highly effective strategies that are tailored to individual requirements for the management and treatment of various diseases.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Purpose. The study aims to understand artificial intelligence as a socio-cultural phenomenon and its impact on education, where the spiritual sphere of humanity, moral norms, values, and human cognitive abilities are preserved, transferred as well as reproduced. A new discourse on the interaction of artificial and authentic human intelligence becomes inevitable, which has led to a situation of uncertainty. Changes in the socio-cultural environment under the influence of artificial intelligence increase potential threats to the educational space, which stimulates to find the ways to eliminate them. Theoretical basis. Various approaches of classical and postmodern philosophical heritage were taken as a theoretical basis for the research. The originality of the study is in the interpretation of artificial intelligence as a modern form of alienation of essential human characteristics in the socio-cultural context of information technology. The expansion of artificial intelligence raises awareness of the existential threat to the basic socio-cultural, moral and ethical principles of humanism. It is proved that various forms of alienation in the current existing socio-cultural space are typical of our reality, which changes the system of values, moral principles, and social organization of the community. Conclusions. In conclusion, it is proved that AI is a natural stage of scientific and technological progress, which reflects its secondary, derivative nature from human (authentic) intelligence. Human intelligence will always have advantages over AI due to its ability to create, communicate socially and culturally, and be emotional. The dilemma of the counterbalance between human and artificial intelligence is perceived mainly at the emotional level of people. The millennial understanding of the primacy of the creator over his creation can traditionally overcome this contradiction. The universality of human thinking is an undeniable advantage of human intelligence and a guarantee of its, i.e. our, priority.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Telepresence robots can be used in different contexts with different goals; for example, to help remote individuals virtually attend classes and meetings, or to allow healthcare workers and patients in different locations to remain in touch. Although these robots bring about different advantages to mediated communication, telepresence pilots have been found to be perceived less favorably than people who are physically present in a communicative context [1]. Thus, in the current work, to mitigate the negative effects of using a telepresence robot, we examine whether an intervention to elicit empathy can influence the way remote participants are perceived. To this end, in a within-subject design, we asked participants (N=30) to follow text-based instructions to do a language learning activity in groups of three, in which one of the participants used a GoBe telepresence robot to join other co-situated group members. We embedded an intervention designed to create empathy with the telepresence operator in the last section of the activity and used two questionnaires, one before and one after the intervention, to collect participants' subjective evaluations of each other. Findings suggest that after the empathy-eliciting question, participants found the telepresence robot user significantly more trustworthy, reliable, and fascinated by art, music, or literature. Results indicate that the empathy-eliciting intervention has a positive effect on the way collocated participants perceive telepresence users.\",\n",

A dataset of 2500 rice images, with each class consisting of 500 images has been used. The dataset was split into training and validation sets, with 400 and 100 images per class, respectively. To enhance the model\\u2019s robustness and accuracy, the images were pre-processed using data augmentation. The model was trained using the Adam optimizer with a categorical cross-entropy loss. confusion matrix is obtained to evaluate the model\\u2019s performance. A comparative analysis of the model with VGG16 and MobileNet was conducted, and the results showed that the proposed model (Resnet50) achieved better accuracy than the others. These findings recommend that deep learning plays a significant role in improving the efficiency and accuracy of rice categorization, which benefits the rice industry by improving quality control, supply chain management, and enhancing consumer confidence in rice products.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Skin cancer is a serious health issue that affects millions of people worldwide. One in every three cancers is a skin cancer and, most people fail to identify and get a diagnosis which is why early detection is essential for effective treatment and improving patient outcomes. In recent years, computer vision and machine learning have become important tools for the automatic detection of skin cancer. One of the commonly used machine learning algorithms for this task is Support Vector Machines (SVMs). SVMs are a type of supervised learning algorithm that is used for classification tasks. In skin cancer detection, the SVM classifier is trained on a dataset of dermatoscopic images of skin lesions. The first step in the process is feature extraction, where relevant information is extracted from the images to serve as input to the SVM classifier. This information can include color, texture, and shape features, among others. \\nThe training and testing of the SVM classifier is then performed using a portion of the dataset, with the remainder being used to evaluate its performance. During the testing phase, the SVM classifier is used to predict the class label of each image, which can be malignant or benign. The accuracy of the classifier is evaluated by comparing its predictions to the actual class labels of the images in the evaluation dataset. \\nThe results of using SVMs in skin cancer detection have been promising, with high accuracy rates being achieved. This highlights the potential of SVMs as a useful tool for skin cancer screening and early detection. In conclusion, the use of SVMs in skin cancer detection provides a fast, automatic, and reliable method for detecting skin cancer, which can help to improve patient outcomes. Currently it is really very important to watch and analyse the cancer disease automatically at intervals the first stages. Irregular streaks square measure one in every of the foremost very important features (included in most of dermoscopy algorithms) that show high association with carcinoma and basal cell malignant growth malady. The diagnostic test technique for the detection is most painful and harmful so we have a tendency to tend to square measure going for the machine-driven detection. Here we have a tendency to tend to square measure practice the GLCM choices for the detection the choices of skin lesions square measure extracted normalized symmetrical grey Level Co-occurrence Matrices GLCM. GLCM based texture choices square measure extracted from each of the four classes and given as input to the Multi-Class Support vector machine that's utilized for classification purpose.\",\n",

      "      \"title\": \"Improved YOLOv5 Algorithm for Real-Time Prediction of Fish Yield in All Cage Schools\",\n",
      "      \"abstract\": \"Cage aquaculture makes it easier to produce high-quality aquatic products and allows full use of water resources. 3Therefore, cage aquaculture development is highly valued globally. However, the current digitalization level of cage aquaculture is low, and the farming risks are high. Research and development of digital management of the fish population in cages are greatly desired. Real-time monitoring of the activity status of the fish population and changes in the fish population size in cages is a pressing issue that needs to be addressed. This paper proposes an improved network called CC-YOLOv5 by embedding CoordConv modules to replace the original ConV convolution modules in the network, which improves the model\\u2019s generalization capability. By using two-stage detection logic, the target detection accuracy is enhanced to realize prediction of the number of fish populations. OpenCV is then used to measure fish tail lengths to establish growth curves of the fish and to predict the output of the fish population in the cages. Experimental results demonstrate that the mean average precision (mAP) of the improved algorithm increases by 14.9% compared to the original YOLOv5, reaching 95.4%. This research provides an effective solution to promote the intelligentization of cage aquaculture processes. It also lays the foundation for AI (Artificial Intelligence) applications in other aquaculture scenarios.\",\n",

The research base is the practical communicative philosophy. Originality. It lies in the fact that the article considered a moral interaction between a person and artificial intelligence. Conclusions. Nowadays modern digital technologies have acquired a new importance. Previously, they were only passive assistants. But now they are able to actively influence human nature not only from the outside, yet also from the inside. Now they influence not only the form of thoughts but also their character. It is artificial intelligence that is the cause of the phenomenon of the \\\"information bubble\\\" (\\\"echo chamber\\\"). They are formed by mathematical algorithms for each individual user of the Internet. It is because of these algorithms, which are the basis of artificial intelligence, that we can conclude: they are guided only by strategic rationality. Therefore, they relate to the Internet user only as an object. That is why such a situation can also be a manifestation of the expansion of strategic rationality into the lifeworld, which gives rise to social pathologies. New digital technologies (first of all, social networks) are becoming an integral part of a person\\u2019s everyday life, and therefore the background of his/her life world. Virtual life becomes an important part of real life. However, virtual life is formed by the influence of the information stream, which constantly sets new \\\"trends\\\", including \\\"trends\\\" on morality. That is why a person begins to perceive only those events that are contained in this stream. Moreover, s\\\\he can express his\\\\her empathy only when s/he him/herself is able to join this stream and express it in virtual life.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"This scientific intervention aims to raise the issue of the automatic processing of natural languages. Especially at its levels related to ontological studies, enabling the machine to recognize information and invest it accurately, beyond the constraints of semantic ambiguity is considered a scientific challenge. This would not be possible without relying on the contextual detection process of linguistic engineering, which is based on a hybrid approach that combines both statistical and linguistic methods. It is an approach that falls within the context of platform linguistics, or what is termed \\\"fourth-generation linguistics\\\", a natural outgrowth of the digital revolution, based on its horizontal extension in various domains and fields of knowledge, thus establishing a new indicative model in which platforms with linguistic and computer interact. In this context, the associative aspects within the compositional linguistic perceptions are a focal point in operating research operations that fall within the automatic processing of natural language, given the nature of its theoretical and methodological architecture with an empirical inductive basis. It also enables the building of computer platforms by preparing morphological, synthetic, semantic, and pragmatic analyzers. Investing in the advanced technological tools provided by the artificial intelligence system; especially in its aspects related to machine learning, deep learning, and neural network; will enable the provision of a linguistic platform capable of developing paths of teaching the Arabic language to non-native speakers.\",\n",

As intelligent manufacturing technologies continue to evolve, numerous data-driven techniques have been available for industrial applications. This case study was aimed at developing a machine-learning algorithm, capable of predicting slag inclusion defects in continuous-casting slabs, based on process condition sensor data. A large dataset consisting of sensor data from nearly 7300 casting samples has been analyzed, with the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) algorithm utilized to process the multi-modal time series. The following machine-learning algorithms have been examined: K-Nearest neighbors, support vector classifier (linear and nonlinear kernels), decision trees, random forests, AdaBoost, and Artificial Neural Networks. Four over-sampling or under-sampling algorithms have been adopted to solve imbalanced data distribution. In the experiment, the optimized random forest outperformed other machine-learning algorithms in terms of recall and ROC AUC, which could provide valuable insights for quality control.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Malware detectors based on deep learning (DL) have been shown to be susceptible to malware examples that have been deliberately manipulated in order to evade detection, a.k.a. adversarial malware examples. More specifically, it has been show that deep learning detectors are vulnerable to small changes on the input file. Given this vulnerability of deep learning detectors, we propose a practical defense against adversarial malware examples inspired by randomized smoothing. In our work, instead of employing Gaussian or Laplace noise when randomizing inputs, we propose a randomized ablation-based smoothing scheme that ablates a percentage of the bytes within an executable. During training, our randomized ablation-based smoothing scheme trains a base classifier based on ablated versions of the executable files. At test time, the final classification for a given input executable is taken as the class most commonly predicted by the classifier on a set of ablated versions of the original executable. To demonstrate the suitability of our approach we have empirically evaluated the proposed ablation-based model against various state-of-the-art evasion attacks on the BODMAS dataset. Results show greater robustness and generalization capabilities to adversarial malware examples in comparison to a non-smoothed classifier.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Artificial neural network potentials (NNPs) have emerged as effective tools for understanding atomic interactions at the atomic scale in various phenomena. Recently, we developed highly transferable NNPs for {\\\\alpha}-iron and {\\\\alpha}-iron/hydrogen binary systems (Physical Review Materials 5 (11), 113606, 2021). These potentials allowed us to investigate deformation and fracture in {\\\\alpha}-iron under the influence of hydrogen. However, the computational cost of the NNP remains relatively high compared to empirical potentials, limiting their applicability in addressing practical issues related to hydrogen embrittlement. In this work, building upon our prior research on iron-hydrogen NNP, we developed a new NNP that not only maintains the excellent transferability but also significantly improves computational efficiency (more than 40 times faster). We applied this new NNP to study the impact of hydrogen on the cracking of iron and the deformation of polycrystalline iron. We employed large-scale through-thickness {110}<110>crack models and large-scale polycrystalline {\\\\alpha}-iron models. The results clearly show that hydrogen atoms segregated at crack tips promote brittle-cleavage failure followed by crack growth. Additionally, hydrogen atoms at grain boundaries facilitate the nucleation of intergranular nanovoids and subsequent intergranular fracture. We anticipate that this high-efficiency NNP will serve as a valuable tool for gaining atomic-scale insights into hydrogen embrittlement.\",\n",

Inspired by several recent works on content-adaptive convolutions, we introduce the GuidedPAKA, the first content-adaptive convolution method specialized for panoptic segmentation. Specifically, GuidedPAKA learns the pixel-adaptive kernel attention consisting of the channel and spatial kernel attentions. Instead of commonly used self-attention operation, we guide the channel and spatial kernel attentions using their respective supervision signals, i.e., semantic segmentation maps and local instance affinities. Consequently, these kernel attentions extract features helpful for panoptic segmentation. Experimental results show that the proposed GuidedPAKA improves the performance of panoptic segmentation when integrated into the baseline model.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Abstract Square-root topology is one of the newest additions to the ever expanding field of topological insulators (TIs). It characterizes systems that relate to their parent TI through the squaring of their Hamiltonians. Extensions to 2 n -root topology, where n is the number of squaring operations involved in retrieving the parent TI, were quick to follow. Here, we go one step further and develop the framework for designing general n-root TIs, with n any positive integer, using the Su\\u2013Schrieffer\\u2013Heeger (SSH) model as the parent TI from which the higher-root versions are constructed. The method relies on using loops of unidirectional couplings as building blocks, such that the resulting model is non-Hermitian and embedded with a generalized chiral symmetry. Edge states are observed at the n branches of the complex energy spectrum, appearing within what we designate as a ring gap, shown to be irreducible to the usual point or line gaps. We further detail on how such an n-root model can be realistically implemented in photonic ring systems. Near perfect unidirectional effective couplings between the main rings can be generated via mediating link rings with modulated gains and losses. These induce high imaginary gauge fields that strongly suppress couplings in one direction, while enhancing them in the other. We use these photonic lattices to validate and benchmark the analytical predictions. Our results introduce a new class of high-root topological models, as well as a route for their experimental realization.\",\n",

The variables were analyzed within the Panel Data Analysis and Machine Learning Approaches frame. \\nResults \\nUnidirectional Granger causality was determined from PM 2.5-NMVOC to CVDALY and revealed that they acted together in the long term. The regression analysis that was made using econometric and multivariate regression models revealed that generally 1 unit increase in PM 2.5 increased CVDALY by between 0.0021-0.0029 units; 1 unit increase in NMVOC increased CVDALY by between 0.00024-0.0004 units. \\nIn Machine Learning approach, it had been determined that if the PM 2.5 and NMVOC were reduced to 0.84- and 9.48 respectively; CVDALY would be decreased to 0.022. In other words, Machine Learning approaches results showed that reducing PM 2.5 by about 4.5 times and NMVOC by about 30% would be reduced CVDALY by about 39.6% from the current status of Turkey. \\nConclusions \\nThe empirical results showed that PM 2.5 - NMVOC increased CVDALY in Turkey. From this perspective establishing and implementing policies to improve air quality in Turkey could be an important approach in reducing cardiovascular diseases.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The presence of a high number of zero flow trades continues to provide a challenge in identifying gravity parameters to explain international trade using the gravity model. Linear regression with a logarithmic linear equation encounters an indefinite value on the logarithmic trade. Although several approaches to solving this problem have been proposed, the majority of them are no longer based on linear regression, making the process of finding solutions more complex. In this work, we suggest a two-step technique for determining the gravity parameters: first, perform linear regression locally to establish a dummy value to substitute trade flow zero, and then estimating the gravity parameters. Iterative techniques are used to determine the optimum parameters. Machine learning is used to test the estimated parameters by analyzing their position in the cluster. We calculated international trade figures for 2004, 2009, 2014, and 2019. We just examine the classic gravity equation and discover that the powers of GDP and distance are in the same cluster and are both worth roughly one. The strategy presented here can be used to solve other problems involving log-linear regression.\",\n",

      "      \"title\": \"On the ability of CNNs to extract color invariant intensity based features for image classification\",\n",
      "      \"abstract\": \"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in vision-related tasks. However, their susceptibility to failing when inputs deviate from the training distribution is well-documented. Recent studies suggest that CNNs exhibit a bias toward texture instead of object shape in image classification tasks, and that background information may affect predictions. This paper investigates the ability of CNNs to adapt to different color distributions in an image while maintaining context and background. The results of our experiments on modified MNIST and FashionMNIST data demonstrate that changes in color can substantially affect classification accuracy. The paper explores the effects of various regularization techniques on generalization error across datasets and proposes a minor architectural modification utilizing the dropout regularization in a novel way that enhances model reliance on color-invariant intensity-based features for improved classification accuracy. Overall, this work contributes to ongoing efforts to understand the limitations and challenges of CNNs in image classification tasks and offers potential solutions to enhance their performance.\",\n",

The robustness of the flip angle of the preparation pulse on the acquired signal is\\u00a0studied.\\n\\n\\nRESULTS\\nWhen a 90\\u00b0 adiabatic pulse is used, the forthcoming T r e c $T_{rec}$ can be expressed as a function of repetition times and AFI flip angle only as TR 1 ( n + cos \\u03b1 ) / ( 1 - cos 2 \\u03b1 ) $\\\\mathrm{TR_1}(n+\\\\cos \\\\alpha )/(1-\\\\cos ^2\\\\alpha )$ , where n represents the ratio between the two repetition times of AFI. The robustness of the method is demonstrated by showing that using the values further away from 90\\u00b0 still allows for a faster approach to SS than the use of dummy\\u00a0pulses.\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nThe preparation module is particularly advantageous for low flip angles, as well as for AFI sequences that sample the center of the k-space early in the sequence, such as centric ordering acquisitions, and for ultrafast EPI-based AFI methods, thus allowing to reduce scanner overhead\\u00a0time.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant promise in modelling relational data and have been widely applied in various fields of interest. The key mechanism behind GNNs is the so-called message passing where information is being iteratively aggregated to central nodes from their neighbourhood. Such a scheme has been found to be intrinsically linked to a physical process known as heat diffusion, where the propagation of GNNs naturally corresponds to the evolution of heat density. Analogizing the process of message passing to the heat dynamics allows to fundamentally understand the power and pitfalls of GNNs and consequently informs better model design. Recently, there emerges a plethora of works that proposes GNNs inspired from the continuous dynamics formulation, in an attempt to mitigate the known limitations of GNNs, such as oversmoothing and oversquashing. In this survey, we provide the first systematic and comprehensive review of studies that leverage the continuous perspective of GNNs. To this end, we introduce foundational ingredients for adapting continuous dynamics to GNNs, along with a general framework for the design of graph neural dynamics. We then review and categorize existing works based on their driven mechanisms and underlying dynamics. We also summarize how the limitations of classic GNNs can be addressed under the continuous framework. We conclude by identifying multiple open research directions.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Synthetic polymers are highly customizable with tailored structures and functionality, yet this versatility generates challenges in the design of advanced materials due to the size and complexity of the design space. Thus, exploration and optimization of polymer properties using combinatorial libraries has become increasingly common, which requires careful selection of synthetic strategies, characterization techniques, and rapid processing workflows to obtain fundamental principles from these large data sets. Herein, we provide guidelines for strategic design of macromolecule libraries and workflows to efficiently navigate these high-dimensional design spaces. We describe synthetic methods for multiple library sizes and structures as well as characterization methods to rapidly generate data sets, including tools that can be adapted from biological workflows. We further highlight relevant insights from statistics and machine learning to aid in data featurization, representation, and analysis. This Perspective acts as a \\u201cuser guide\\u201d for researchers interested in leveraging high-throughput screening toward the design of multifunctional polymers and predictive modeling of structure\\u2013property relationships in soft materials.\",\n",

Currently, a unified diagnostic standard incorporating both computed tomography (CT) images and numerical text data for PJI remains unestablished, owing to the substantial noise in CT images and the disparity in data volume between CT images and text data. This study introduces a diagnostic method, HGT, based on deep learning and multimodal techniques.

We evaluated the proposed method on a custom-built multimodal PJI dataset, assessing its performance through ablation experiments and interpretability evaluations. Our method achieved an accuracy (ACC) of 91.4% and an area under the curve (AUC) of 95.9%, outperforming recent multimodal approaches by 2.9% in ACC and 2.2% in AUC, with a parameter count of only 68 M.

Orientation maps revealed the existence of two distinct types of planar dislocation boundaries both at 0.6$\\\\%$ and 1.7$\\\\%$ but no systematic patterning. At 3.6$\\\\%$, these boundaries have evolved into a well-defined checkerboard pattern, characteristic of Geometrically Necessary Boundaries, GNBs. The GNB spacing is $\\\\approx$ 14 $\\\\mu$m and the misorientation $\\\\approx$ 0.2{\\\\deg}, in fair agreement with those at higher strains. By contrast to the sharp boundaries observed at higher strains, the boundaries are associated with a sinusoidal orientation gradient.

Microscopic examination of blood samples can detect and differentiate parasite species, but it is time consuming and requires expert microscopists, a resource that is not always available. In this context, artificial intelligence (AI) can assist in the diagnosis of this disease by automatically detecting and differentiating microfilarias. In line with the target product profile for lymphatic filariasis as defined by the World Health Organization, we developed an edge AI system running on a smartphone whose camera is aligned with the ocular of an optical microscope that detects and differentiates filarias species in real time without the internet connection. Our object detection algorithm that uses the Single-Shot Detection (SSD) MobileNet V2 detection model was developed with 115 cases, 85 cases with 1903 fields of view and 3342 labels for model training, and 30 cases with 484 fields of view and 873 labels for model validation before clinical validation, is able to detect microfilarias at 10x magnification and distinguishes four species of them at 40x magnification: Loa loa, Mansonella perstans, Wuchereria bancrofti, and Brugia malayi. We validated our augmented microscopy system in the clinical environment by replicating the diagnostic workflow encompassed examinations at 10x and 40x with the assistance of the AI models analyzing 18 samples with the AI running on a middle range smartphone. It achieved an overall precision of 94.14%, recall of 91.90% and F1 score of 93.01% for the screening algorithm and 95.46%, 97.81% and 96.62% for the species differentiation algorithm respectively. This innovative solution has the potential to support filariasis diagnosis and monitoring, particularly in resource-limited settings where access to expert technicians and laboratory equipment is scarce.\",\n",

The main driving force behind this study is determining which translator, along with the blend of word embedding and Machine Learning(ML)techniques, has greater accuracy when working with the Japanese Language. Business owners struggle to understand how their products perform in Japan and receive feedback to improve it. Japanese is among the most complex languages to read and write. The issue can be resolved by classifying reviews and ratings into separate groups, such as excellent and negative so business owners can improve their products based on the reviews. This study examines the reviews and ratings from the Japanese-language Amazon Product Review dataset. These reviews have been translated into English using three different translators (Google - GT, Microsoft - MT, and Python - PT). The data for each translator is then subjected to a combination of word embedding techniques (Count Vector, TF-IDF, and Word2vec) and machine learning techniques (Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest Classifier (RF), Decision Tree Classifier (DT), and XG Boost Classifier (XGB). According to the study's findings, the Python Translator, combined with a TF-IDF and LR mix, exceeds all other translators with an accuracy of 89.96%.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"While carotid plaque composition and structure indicate vulnerability to rupture, few such vulnerable plaques ultimately give rise to strokes. We herein evaluate if in vivo ARFI log(VoA) delineations of plaque morphology differentiate symptomatic plaques, which carry high stroke risk, from those that are asymptomatic and have lower stroke risk. Forty-one carotid plaques in patients with clinical indication for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) to prevent stroke and 26 plaques in patients without indication for CEA were imaged. Among these plaques, 33 were symptomatic and 34 were asymptomatic. When plaques were segmented manually by a blinded reader or automatically by a machine-learning classifier, no there were no statistically significant differences in total plaque area or in percent area of calcium, collagen, necrotic core, or intraplaque hemorrhage between symptomatic and asymptomatic plaques. Further, all plaque features yielded AUC scores <0.6 in ability to distinguish symptomatic from asymptomatic. These findings, which are consistent with expectation, suggest that plaque morphology alone does not precisely predict rupture potential and, thus, additional risk factors, such as wall shear stress, may be required for individualized stroke risk prediction.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Contrastive learning on graphs aims at extracting distinguishable high-level representations of nodes. We theoretically illustrate that the entropy of a dataset is approximated by maximizing the lower bound of the mutual information across different views of a graph, i.e., entropy is estimated by a neural network. Based on this finding, we propose a simple yet effective subset sampling strategy to contrast pairwise representations between views of a dataset. In particular, we randomly sample nodes and edges from a given graph to build the input subset for a view. Two views are fed into a parameter-shared Siamese network to extract the high-dimensional embeddings and estimate the information entropy of the entire graph. For the learning process, we propose to optimize the network using two objectives, simultaneously. Concretely, the input of the contrastive loss consists of positive and negative pairs. Our selection strategy of pairs is different from previous works and we present a novel strategy to enhance the representation ability by selecting nodes based on cross-view similarities. We enrich the diversity of the positive and negative pairs by selecting highly similar samples and totally different data with the guidance of cross-view similarity scores, respectively. We also introduce a cross-view consistency constraint on the representations generated from the different views. We conduct experiments on seven graph benchmarks, and the proposed approach achieves competitive performance compared to the current state-of-the-art methods.

According to current research, deep learning may produce high-quality segmentation of brain tumor areas in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data. The diagnosis of brain cancers can be aided by using these segmented sections. Fully convolutional networks (FCNs) and 3D U-nets, two deep learning algorithms, have shown to be more accurate than more conventional methods such level set methods, active contours, and graph cuts. FCNs provide an end-to-end solution for segmentation, while 3D U-nets are designed to capture spatial context and incorporate prior information about tumor shapes, enabling more accurate segmentation results. These techniques have also been utilized to segment gliomas and meningiomas, two different forms of brain tumors. In the upcoming years, it is anticipated that deep learning would improve accuracy and diagnostic precision in the field of brain tumor segmentation\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The combinatorial effect of genetic variants is often assumed to be additive. Although genetic variation can clearly interact non-additively, methods to uncover epistatic relationships remain in their infancy. We develop low-signal signed iterative random forests to elucidate the complex genetic architecture of cardiac hypertrophy. We derive deep learning-based estimates of left ventricular mass from the cardiac MRI scans of 29,661 individuals enrolled in the UK Biobank. We report epistatic genetic variation including variants close to CCDC141, IGF1R, TTN, and TNKS. Several loci not prioritized by univariate genome-wide association analysis are identified. Functional genomic and integrative enrichment analyses reveal a complex gene regulatory network in which genes mapped from these loci share biological processes and myogenic regulatory factors. Through a network analysis of transcriptomic data from 313 explanted human hearts, we show that these interactions are preserved at the level of the cardiac transcriptome. We assess causality of epistatic effects via RNA silencing of gene-gene interactions in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. Finally, single-cell morphology analysis using a novel high-throughput microfluidic system shows that cardiomyocyte hypertrophy is non-additively modifiable by specific pairwise interactions between CCDC141 and both TTN and IGF1R. Our results expand the scope of genetic regulation of cardiac structure to epistasis.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Deep neural networks (DNNs) excel at industrial fault diagnosis. Their performance heavily relies on the quality of human-annotated labels. Due to perception limitations of annotators, industrial time series samples (such as vibration and voltage signals) are frequently mislabeled in several conditions, such as samples with frequency domain feature differences and samples on class borders. Hence, an annotated industrial dataset will inevitably contain noisy labels at a certain level, leading to overfitting and poor generalization of DNNs. In this work, we introduce an industrial noisy label semisupervised learning (INL-SSL) fault diagnosis approach, addressing the problem that a certain number of samples in an industrial dataset are mislabeled. The proposed INL-SSL architecture simultaneously trains two DNNs, which cross-train on each other to filter noisy label errors. In particular, a fitted Gaussian mixture model divides time series samples of each DNN flow into an unlabeled set with samples likely to be noisy and a labeled set with samples likely to be clean. Given the labeled and unlabeled data, we proposed a time series MixMatch semisupervised learning strategy to train the diagnostic model. Ablation study verifies the benefit of the proposed time series augmentation techniques for semisupervised training. Extensive experiments on a benchmark industrial dataset of rolling element bearings (REB) reveal that the INL-SSL outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. On another self-collected REB dataset, the proposed approach also exceeds other comparison methods under noise ratios from 20% to 90%, validating the model's generalizability.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Imitation learning considerably simplifies policy synthesis compared to alternative approaches by exploiting access to expert demonstrations. For such imitation policies, errors away from the training samples are particularly critical. Even rare slip-ups in the policy action outputs can compound quickly over time, since they lead to unfamiliar future states where the policy is still more likely to err, eventually causing task failures. We revisit simple supervised ``behavior cloning'' for conveniently training the policy from nothing more than pre-recorded demonstrations, but carefully design the model class to counter the compounding error phenomenon. Our ``memory-consistent neural network'' (MCNN) outputs are hard-constrained to stay within clearly specified permissible regions anchored to prototypical ``memory'' training samples. We provide a guaranteed upper bound for the sub-optimality gap induced by MCNN policies. Using MCNNs on 9 imitation learning tasks, with MLP, Transformer, and Diffusion backbones, spanning dexterous robotic manipulation and driving, proprioceptive inputs and visual inputs, and varying sizes and types of demonstration data, we find large and consistent gains in performance, validating that MCNNs are better-suited than vanilla deep neural networks for imitation learning applications.

      "      \"abstract\": \"Compact models are integral part of large-scale integrated circuit simulations and validation of new technologies. With technology scaling, however, compact models have become complex with lots of parameters involved. Hence, parameter extraction for new device technology is rather challenging. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic approach to compact model parameter extraction. We devise a Bayesian optimization technique which is specifically tailored for efficient extraction of BSIMCMG parameters for fitting nanowire junctionless transistors and 14nm FinFETs. The Bayesian optimization based extraction results show excellent fit to drain current data, with 6.5% normalized root-mean-square error for nanowire junctionless transistors. For a 14nm FinFET, the technique achieves 6.3% and 1.5% for drain current and capacitance data, respectively. This compares favourably to current tools available as well and improves on current tools available including industrial ones.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Deep neural networks (DNNs) are easily exposed to backdoor threats when training with poisoned training samples. Models using backdoor attack have normal performance for benign samples, and possess poor performance for poisoned samples manipulated with pre-defined trigger patterns. Currently, research on backdoor attacks focuses on image classification and object detection. In this article, we investigated backdoor attacks in facial sketch synthesis, which can be beneficial for many applications, such as animation production and assisting police in searching for suspects. Specifically, we propose a simple yet effective poison-only backdoor attack suitable for generation tasks. We demonstrate that when the backdoor is integrated into the target model via our attack, it can mislead the model to synthesize unacceptable sketches of any photos stamped with the trigger patterns. Extensive experiments are executed on the benchmark datasets. Specifically, the light strokes devised by our backdoor attack strategy can significantly decrease the perceptual quality. However, the FSIM score of light strokes is 68.21% on the CUFS dataset and the FSIM scores of pseudo-sketches generated by FCN, cGAN, and MDAL are 69.35%, 71.53%, and 72.75%, respectively. There is no big difference, which proves the effectiveness of the proposed backdoor attack method.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Neuromorphic systems-on-chip (NSoCs) integrate CPU cores and neuromorphic hardware accelerators on the same chip. These platforms can execute spiking deep convolutional neural networks (SDCNNs) with a low energy footprint. Modern NSoCs are heterogeneous in terms of their computing, communication, and storage resources. This makes scheduling SDCNN operations a combinatorial problem of exploring an exponentially-large state space in determining mapping, ordering, and timing of operations to achieve a target hardware performance, e.g., throughput. We propose a systematic design flow to schedule SDCNNs on an NSoC. Our scheduler, called SMART (SDCNN MApping, OrdeRing, and Timing), branches the combinatorial optimization problem into computationally-relaxed sub-problems that generate fast solutions without significantly compromising the solution quality. SMART improves performance by efficiently incorporating the heterogeneity in computing, communication, and storage resources. SMART operates in four steps. First, it creates a self-timed execution schedule to map operations to compute resources, maximizing throughput. Second, it uses an optimization strategy to distribute activation and synaptic weights to storage resources, minimizing data communication-related overhead. Third, it constructs an inter-processor communication (IPC) graph with a transaction order for its communication actors. This transaction order is created using a transaction partial order algorithm, which minimizes contention on the shared communication resources. Finally, it schedules this IPC graph to hardware by overlapping communication with the computation, and leveraging operation, pipeline, and batch parallelism. We evaluate SMART using 10 representative image, object, and language-based SDCNNs. Results show that SMART increases throughput by an average 23%, compared to a state-of-the-art scheduler. SMART is implemented entirely in software as a compiler extension. It doesn\\u2019t require any change in a neuromorphic hardware or its interface to CPUs. It improves throughput with only a marginal increase in the compilation time. SMART is released under the open-source MIT licensing at https://github.com/drexel-DISCO/SMART to foster future research.\",\n",

We propose to eliminate the temporal domain of feature vectors by computing the mean and standard deviation of each variable across all video frames. Thus, each video is represented by a single feature vector of 67 variables. As for the motion vectors, we eliminated their temporal domain by projecting their phases using PCA, thus representing each video by a single feature vector with a length equal to the number of frames in a video. Consequently, complex classifiers such as LSTM can be avoided and classical machine learning techniques can be used instead. Experimental results on the JHMDB dataset resulted in average classification accuracies of 68.8% and 74.2% when using the projected phases of motion vectors and video coding feature variables, respectively. The advantage of the proposed solution is the use of FVs with low dimensionality and simple machine learning techniques.\",\n",

It is assumed that the regression function is from the H\\\\\\\"older space with smoothness $\\\\alpha<(d+3)/2$ or a variation space corresponding to shallow neural networks, which can be viewed as an infinitely wide neural network.

We propose and demonstrate an unconventional type of nonlinear mapping of a linear random-scattering cavity, based on nonlinear relation between optical scattering potential and multiply-scattered light. It is realized by reconfiguring the optical scattering potential. High-order nonlinear mapping is obtained experimentally at low optical power. The order of nonlinear mapping can be tuned over a wide range, in sharp contrast to conventional optical nonlinearity based on intrinsic material response. Our method of achieving nonlinear mapping is robust and free of temporal instability. Such nonlinear mapping also enables tuning of scattered light statistics. This work has broad applications in metrology, cryptography, artificial neural networks, and optical computing.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Topological data analysis (TDA) has emerged as a powerful tool for extracting meaningful insights from complex data. TDA enhances the analysis of objects by embedding them into a simplicial complex and extracting useful global properties such as the Betti numbers, i.e. the number of multidimensional holes, which can be used to define kernel methods that are easily integrated with existing machine-learning algorithms. These kernel methods have found broad applications, as they rely on powerful mathematical frameworks which provide theoretical guarantees on their performance. However, the computation of higher-dimensional Betti numbers can be prohibitively expensive on classical hardware, while quantum algorithms can approximate them in polynomial time in the instance size. In this work, we propose a quantum approach to defining topological kernels, which is based on constructing Betti curves, i.e. topological fingerprint of filtrations with increasing order. We exhibit a working prototype of our approach implemented on a noiseless simulator and show its robustness by means of some empirical results suggesting that topological approaches may offer an advantage in quantum machine learning.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Long text matching is widely used in various sub-tasks of natural language processing. However, conducting research in this field can be challenging due to excessive redundant and distracting information, the complex semantic context, and the limited availability of high quality public datasets. Existing long text matching methods generally do not fully use the rich local features embedded in text information, and focus more on encoding long text as fixed length vectors to calculate the semantic distance, disregarding the importance of feature interaction in the text matching process. Therefore, the performance of the relevant models needs to be improved. To address these problems, a hierarchical and multiple-perspective interaction network (HMIN) is proposed in this paper. First, the long text is encoded at the word and sentence levels to extract global features, while one-dimensional convolutional neural networks and attention mechanisms are used to focus on important local features in long texts. Second, the different types of features are compared separately using the comparison function, and then, the comparison results are aggregated. Finally, whether long texts are matched is determined in the prediction layer. We have conducted comparative experiments on two datasets, the results show that HMIN has an improvement in accuracy and F1 values compared with the same type of existing algorithms, and the related experimental analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Rwandan coffee holds significant importance and immense value within the realm of agriculture, serving as a vital and valuable commodity. Additionally, coffee plays a pivotal role in generating foreign exchange for numerous developing nations. However, the coffee plant is vulnerable to pests and diseases weakening production. Farmers in cooperation with experts use manual methods to detect diseases resulting in human errors. With the rapid improvements in deep learning methods, it is possible to detect and recognize plan diseases to support crop yield improvement. Therefore, it is an essential task to develop an efficient method for intelligently detecting, identifying, and predicting coffee leaf diseases. This study aims to build the Rwandan coffee plant dataset, with the occurrence of coffee rust, miner, and red spider mites identified to be the most popular due to their geographical situations. From the collected coffee leaves dataset of 37,939 images, the preprocessing, along with modeling used five deep learning models such as InceptionV3, ResNet50, Xception, VGG16, and DenseNet. The training, validation, and testing ratio is 80%, 10%, and 10%, respectively, with a maximum of 10 epochs. The comparative analysis of the models\\u2019 performances was investigated to select the best for future portable use. The experiment proved the DenseNet model to be the best with an accuracy of 99.57%. The efficiency of the suggested method is validated through an unbiased evaluation when compared to existing approaches with different metrics.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"This article is dedicated to addressing the current challenge of augmenting the load-bearingcapability of pile foundations. This predicament is most effectively addressed by employing piles with unconventional geometries along with atypical methodologies for installing these foundation piles. The primary objective of the research wasto examine the impact of various fill materials (including both soil and rigid substances) on the energy consumption during pile driving and the resistance to static loads by piles with multiple shaft expansions. The findings derived from model-based investigations demonstrate that the load-bearing capacity of piles with shaft expansions installed with bulk material filling surpassed that of conventional piles (prismatic and pyramidal) by a factor ranging from 1.5 to 4.6. Furthermore, the research outcomes also indicated greater energy consumption (1.14\\u20131.66 times) and enhanced load-bearing capacity (1.15\\u20131.68 times) for piles with shaft expansions driven with backfill in comparison to piles installed without backfill. It is noteworthy that the type of backfill material significantly influenced the energy consumption during pile driving and their stability under axial static loads. The correlation relationships can be applied to approximate projection of the energy-related and structural parameters of piles with shaft expansions embedded with the addition of bulk materials.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"With the current ubiquity of deep learning methods to solve computer vision and remote sensing specific tasks, the need for labelled data is growing constantly. However, in many cases, the annotation process can be long and tedious depending on the expertise needed to perform reliable annotations. In order to alleviate this need for annotations, several self-supervised methods have recently been proposed in the literature. The core principle behind these methods is to learn an image encoder using solely unlabelled data samples. In earth observation, there are opportunities to exploit domain-specific remote sensing image data in order to improve these methods. Specifically, by leveraging the geographical position associated with each image, it is possible to cross reference a location captured from multiple sensors, leading to multiple views of the same locations. In this paper, we briefly review the core principles behind so-called joint-embeddings methods and investigate the usage of multiple remote sensing modalities in self-supervised pre-training. We evaluate the final performance of the resulting encoders on the task of methane source classification.\",\n",

However, in today's increasingly explosive development of information on the Internet, by contrast, traditional search engines have problems such as semantic understanding and complicated answers. Therefore, question answering systems are more important. The automatic question answering system generally adopts natural language processing related technologies. When users ask questions, the system automatically judges and gives answers. It involves computer linguistics, machine learning, artificial intelligence and other popular technology research. According to different classification criteria, the automatic question answering system is roughly divided into open field automatic question answering system and stereotyped automatic question answering system.. This thesis investigates methods and applications related to question-and-answer dialogue systems. On the methodological side, we introduce commonly used datasets and the principles and techniques of text, speech and visual question and answer systems, and analyse in detail the excellent example ChatGPT.

      "      \"abstract\": \"Pine wilt disease is a destructive forest disease caused by the parasitism of pine wood nematodes inside pine trees. Once infected, pine trees quickly wither and die due to the inability to drain water, hence it is also known as pine tree withering disease. It is mainly spread by pine sawyer beetles, with the characteristics of fast dissemination, rapid onset, and high mortality rate, making it a significant global plant disease. Failure to effectively control the pine wilt disease in a timely manner will result in the massive death of pine trees in a short period of time in forest areas. With the continuous development and popularization of artificial intelligence and UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) technology, combining various methods can timely detect diseased trees, and performing timely treatment and protection can greatly save the time and personnel costs of biological pest control. While it is also conducive to promoting the work of multiple related disciplines, such as bioengineering and greening engineering. In this paper, we first conducted a large number of aerial surveys on the forest area through UAV, collected relevant data, and preprocessed the obtained data, including data augmentation, cleaning, filtering, deduplication, formatting, etc., to ensure data quality and accuracy. Then, we labeled the data, and made certain improvements to the original YOLOv5. We added a new RRAM (Recurrent Residual Attention Module) to the original network model, which enables the network to timely focus on important information in redundant data, thus improving the network\\u2019s performance.

      "      \"abstract\": \"A Multi-Agent Cooperative Learning (MACL) system is an artificial intelligence (AI) system where multiple learning agents work together to complete a common task. Recent empirical success of MACL systems in various domains (e.g. traffic control, cloud computing, robotics) has sparked active research into the design and analysis of MACL systems for sequential decision making problems. One important metric of the learning algorithm for decision making problems is its regret, i.e. the difference between the highest achievable reward and the actual reward that the algorithm gains. The design and development of a MACL system with low-regret learning algorithms can create huge economic values. In this thesis, I analyze MACL systems for different sequential decision making problems. Concretely, the Chapter 3 and 4 investigate the cooperative multi-agent multi-armed bandit problems, with full-information or bandit feedback, in which multiple learning agents can exchange their information through a communication network and the agents can only observe the rewards of the actions they choose. Chapter 5 considers the communication-regret trade-off for online convex optimization in the distributed setting. Chapter 6 discusses how to form high-productive teams for agents based on their unknown but fixed types using adaptive incremental matchings. For the above problems, I present the regret lower bounds for feasible learning algorithms and provide the efficient algorithms to achieve this bound. The regret bounds I present in Chapter 3, 4 and 5 quantify how the regret depends on the connectivity of the communication network and the communication delay, thus giving useful guidance on design of the communication protocol in MACL systems\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Energy generation is moving away from centralized fossil fuel based generators towards renewable energy to provide clean and reliable sources. Hydrogen-based generation such as solid oxide fuel cell is one of the promising solution. For efficient and optimized operations of the overall system, e.g. frequency or voltage support actions, accurate dynamic models of the generators can be highly beneficial. Those are often not provided by manufacturers in sufficient detail. Since the dynamics of fuel cells are non-linear and depend on a high number of hard-to-measure parameters, white-box models are often hard or impossible to implement. The goal of this work is to develop and implement methods for data-driven physics-based model identification for partially unknown solid oxide fuel cells, that function with minimal measurement data. A mechanistic gray box model, a pre-trained feed forward neural network and long short-term memory neural network are implemented. They are evaluated by comparing their output to that of a simulated fuel cell stack in different scenarios. For large variations in operating conditions, the feed forward network shows the best performance. Close to the maximum power point, the long-short term memory based model performs best.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Hydroponics is a type of soil-free farming that uses less water and other resources than conventional soil-based farming methods. Hydroponic cultivation system has high yield per acre of land with minimal consumption of water and can be a possible to meet the growing food demand of the world. The hydroponic plants fertility must be preserved, proper nutrition, a environmental temperature, and nutrient stability are crucial. It will be simpler for a farmer to keep track of all hydroponic plants by automatically monitoring nutrient flow and ambient temperature stability. By implementing artificial intelligence-based regulating algorithms in the agriculture industry, recent technology advancements are highly helpful in resolving these issues. This paper presents, automated hydroponic nutrient control system (AHNCS) for smart agriculture. System architecture is consisting of sensors network, Raspberry pi 4 microcontroller and actuators.

      "      \"abstract\": \"In the past three years, global COVID-19 pandemic not only impacted people\\u2019s physical health but also significantly affected their mental health, which resulting in rapid increase of psychological problems. Emotions are a common manifestation of psychological changes, and some services (such as music, video, or psychological counseling services) can help users to adjust their emotions in a timely manner, thus to avoid bringing extreme events (e.g., running away from home or committing suicide). Therefore, how to perceive users\\u2019 real-time emotions and then recommend the most appropriate services to users has become a challenge. To address this issue, this work proposes an approach for proactive services recommendation driven-by multimodal emotion recognition (named as PSRMER). Specifically, PSRMER first actively identifies a user\\u2019s emotion with a multimodal emotion recognition model based on BiGRU and Transformer; Then, considering the user\\u2019s emotion and preferences, PSRMER selects the optimal services based on an index-graph linking different emotions and various services; Finally, PSRMER proactively recommends the selected optimal service to the user. Extensive experiments have been conducted and the effectiveness of our proposed method have been proved. Moreover, the proposed method can also be used in smart education, smart transportation, smart elderly care and other modern industry fields.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Finite Element codes used for solving the mechanical equilibrium equations in transient problems associated to (time-dependent) viscoelastic media generally relies on time-discretized versions of the selected constitutive law. Recent concerns about the use of non-integer differential equations to describe viscoelasticity or well-founded ideas based upon the use of a behavior's law directly derived from Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) experiments in frequency domain, could make the Laplace domain approach particularly attractive if embedded in a time discretized scheme. Based upon the inversion of Laplace transforms, this paper shows that this aim is not only possible but also gives rise to a simple algorithm having good performances in terms of computation times and precision. Such an approach, which fully relies on the Laplace-defined Behavioral Transfer Function (LTBF) can be promoted if it uses AutoRegressive with eXogeneous input parametric models perfectly substitutable to the real LTBF. They avoid the hitherto prohibitive pitfall of having to store all past data in the computer's memory while maintaining an equal computation precision.\",\n",

To realize the routine assessment of cancer prognosis and treatment, we demonstrate the development of an Intelligent Disease Detection Tool (IDDT), a microfluidic-based tumor model integrated with deep learning-assisted algorithmic analysis. IDDT was clinically validated with liquid blood biopsy samples (n\\u2009=\\u200971) from patients with various types of cancers (e.g., breast, gastric, and lung cancer) and healthy donors, requiring low sample volume (\\u223c200\\u2009\\u03bcl) and a high-throughput 3D tumor culturing system (\\u223c300 tumor clusters). To support automated algorithmic analysis, intelligent decision-making, and precise segmentation, we designed and developed an integrative deep neural network, which includes Mask Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network (Mask R-CNN), vision transformer, and Segment Anything Model (SAM). Our approach significantly reduces the manual labeling time by up to 90% with a high mean Intersection Over Union (mIoU) of 0.902 and immediate results (<2\\u2009s per image) for clinical cohort classification. The IDDT can accurately stratify healthy donors (n\\u2009=\\u200912) and cancer patients (n\\u2009=\\u200955) within their respective treatment cycle and cancer stage, resulting in high precision (\\u223c99.3%) and high sensitivity (\\u223c98%).

The KNN algorithm is a supervised learning method that uses distance between data points to forecast outcomes. The system was used to find trends and forecast potential hotspots after being trained on previous crime data. The study also takes into account social and environmental elements that influence the frequency of crimes in hotspots. The study's findings give insight into the fundamental causes of criminal activity and show that the KNN algorithm may be successfully used to identify crime hotspots. In order to lower crime rates in high-risk locations, law enforcement agencies and urban planners can benefit from this research in establishing focused crime prevention efforts. However, the quality of the data and the algorithm's capacity to recognize pertinent patterns both affect how accurate the forecasts turn out to be. Exploring the potential and restrictions of this method to crime prediction will require more research. In general, using the KNN algorithm to anticipate crime hotspots has shown promise and has the potential to help create efficient crime prevention tactics.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Marine raft aquaculture plays a significant role in promoting economic development and ensuring national food security. However, its rapid expansion has led to issues such as marine environmental pollution and illegal use of sea areas. SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) imagery, with its all-weather, all-day observation capabilities, provides a new data source for monitoring marine raft aquaculture. However, there are issues of incomplete raft aquaculture type recognition and underutilization of polarized SAR information in current research. Consequently, this paper proposed a segmentation method named dual-branch hybrid encoding network (DBHE-Net) based on GF-3 full-polarization SAR image, which effectively integrated CNN's local perception and Transformer's global expression capabilities for raft aquaculture type recognition. Experiment results demonstrated that DBHE-Net outperforms other classical semantic segmentation models, with a mIoU accuracy of 79.46%. The introduction of the Transformer branch significantly improved the extraction accuracy of fully floating raft aquaculture. This paper holds significant importance for the rational planning of aquaculture areas and the scientific management of coastal ecological environments.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Precisely identifying sulcal features in brain MRI is made challenging by the variability of brain folding. This research introduces an innovative 3D explainability frame-work that validates outputs from deep learning networks in their ability to detect the paracingulate sulcus, an anatomical feature that may or may not be present on the frontal medial surface of the human brain. This study trained and tested two networks, amalgamating local explainability techniques GradCam and SHAP with a dimensionality reduction method. The explainability framework provided both localized and global explanations, along with accuracy of classification results, revealing pertinent sub-regions contributing to the decision process through a post-fusion transformation of explanatory and statistical features. Leveraging the TOP-OSLO dataset of MRI acquired from patients with schizophrenia, greater accuracies of paracingulate sulcus detection (presence or absence) were found in the left compared to right hemispheres with distinct, but extensive sub-regions contributing to each classification outcome. The study also inadvertently highlighted the critical role of an unbiased annotation protocol in maintaining network performance fairness. Our proposed method not only offers automated, impartial annotations of a variable sulcus but also provides insights into the broader anatomical variations associated with its presence throughout the brain. The adoption of this methodology holds promise for instigating further explorations and inquiries in the field of neuroscience.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in automated program reasoning, a crucial aspect of many security tasks. However, existing LLM architectures for code are often borrowed from other domains like natural language processing, raising concerns about their generalization and robustness to unseen code. A key generalization challenge is to incorporate the knowledge of code semantics, including control and data flow, into the LLM architectures. Drawing inspiration from examples of convolution layers exploiting translation symmetry, we explore how code symmetries can enhance LLM architectures for program analysis and modeling. We present a rigorous group-theoretic framework that formally defines code symmetries as semantics-preserving transformations and provides techniques for precisely reasoning about symmetry preservation within LLM architectures. Using this framework, we introduce a novel variant of self-attention that preserves program symmetries, demonstrating its effectiveness in generalization and robustness through detailed experimental evaluations across different binary and source code analysis tasks. Overall, our code symmetry framework offers rigorous and powerful reasoning techniques that can guide the future development of specialized LLMs for code and advance LLM-guided program reasoning tasks.\",\n",

However, using a compliant element adds new nonlinearities to the system. Considering this, the work presented aims to develop models to describe and characterize the elastomer-based elastic joint (eSEA). Three models are proposed: a linear, a nonlinear, and a combined model. The parametric linear model is implemented using the AutoRegressive Moving Average model with the eXogenous (ARMAX) model, and the nonlinear model used is the Nonlinear Autoregressive eXogenous (NARX) model using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The last model combines the linear model and an ANN. The models\\u2019 predictions are analyzed and compared with the experimental data obtained from an original assembly. The ANNs show an important ability to characterize the nonlinearities involved in flexible joint dynamics. The nonlinear model composed by an ANN makes adequate predictions compared to the linear model. The best model is obtained using the linear model and ANN, decreasing the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by 93%.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Jumlah berita atau dokumen yang sangat melimpah merupakan sumber pengetahuan yang sangat berharga dan dapat digunakan untuk memperoleh wawasan dalam pengambilan keputusan. Namun, pertumbuhan jumlah berita dengan dimensi yang tinggi menjadi sebuah tantangan besar, yang menyebabkan sulitnya informasi pada berita dikategorikan secara efisien dan cepat. Kesulitan ini semakin kompleks dengan tidak adanya kelas atau label pada berita tersebut. Analisis konten dari berita yang belum memiliki kelas atau label dapat dilakukan dengan pendekatan data mining. Salah satu metode data mining yang dapat digunakan untuk mengelompokkan berita tanpa label, jumlah yang besar, dan sulit dilakukan secara manual adalah klastering. Klastering teks adalah salah satu metode penambangan data yang bertujuan untuk mengelompokkan dokumen berdasarkan kesamaan atau kemiripan di antara teks. Penelitian ini memberikan pendekatan baru dalam mengelompokkan berita Bahasa Indonesia dengan metode klastering, dimana ekstraksi fitur dilakukan melalui pendekatan Neural Network (Word Embedding) yang dapat menunjukkan kesamaan antar kata untuk mempertahankan semantik dan konteks dari kata yang ada pada berita. Sumber data yang digunakan adalah berita dari portal berita \\u201cTempo\\u201d yang terdiri dari 520863 berita. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa jumlah klaster k = 4, dengan parameter Word Embedding: min_count=1 dan embedding_size=300 memberikan nilai silhouette coefficient terbaik sebesar 0.73. Hasil klasterisasi berita divisualisasikan dalam bentuk dimensi yang berbeda dan visualisasi World Cloud untuk menganalisis dan mengevaluasi metode yang diusulkan pada penelitian ini.\\u00a0AbstractThe enormous amount of news or documents is a precious source of knowledge and can be used to gain insight into decision-making. However, the growth in the number of news stories with high dimensions is a big challenge, making it difficult for information on the news to be categorized efficiently and quickly. This difficulty is further complicated by the absence of classes or labels on the news. Analysis of the content of news that does not yet have a class or label can be done with a data mining approach. The most used data mining method to group a tremendous amount of news without class labels is clustering. Text clustering is a data mining task that aims to group documents based on similarities. This study provides a new approach to classifying Indonesian news with the clustering method, where feature extraction is carried out through a Neural Network (Word Embedding) approach that can show similarities between words to maintain the semantics and context of the words in the news. The data source used is news from the news portal \\\"Tempo,\\\" which consists of 5208063 news. The results showed that the number of clusters k = 4, with Word Embedding parameters: min_count=1 and embedding_size=300, produced the best silhouette coefficient value of 0.73. The results of news clustering were visualized in the form of different dimensions and World Cloud visualization to analyze and evaluate the proposed method.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Urban planning plays a pivotal role in guaranteeing the functionality, accessibility, and adaptability of cities to meet the needs of their diverse population and various official and informal economic activities. The primary objective of this work is to investigate the application of machine learning techniques in the identification of optimal places for vegetable vendors within the urban context of Raipur City, India. While logistic regression has been used in previous studies to address issues such as soil erosion, land susceptibility mapping, and identifying potential sites for health facilities and mining exploration, this model has yet to be applied to determining suitable locations for vegetable vendors. This gap in research could be beneficial if addressed, particularly in India, where many city residents rely heavily on vegetable vendors for their dietary needs. The paper\\u2019s main focus is on evaluating the reliability of the model and encouraging its implementation in similar scenarios, highlighting its efficiency and adaptability, which are also evaluated in this study. A stratified random sampling technique was implemented to collect data from four different regions of Raipur City. Subsequently, the gathered data was subjected to analysis employing the logistic regression machine learning technique, with the objective of making predictions. The results obtained from the analysis were highly impressive, as the model successfully predicted 44 out of the total 50 locations with an accuracy rate of 88%.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Wine quality is rather important for alcohol industry, especially for some unique product (e.g., Vinho Verde). Since the quality evaluation of wine is often part of the certification process and is helpful for setting prices, it is necessary to find a model with the highest model accuracy to predict the quality. The paper collected the red wine data from a certain database and changed it to a classification problem with quality as 0 to bad and 1 to good. This dataset is like a normal distribution with the quality of 5 and 6 having the highest ratio. In order to find the approach with the best performance, five machine learning approaches are adopted and compared in terms of various metrics and judgments. According to the analysis, the Support-vector machine (SVM) model predicts preforms the best, i.e., the model has the highest accuracy. This article is a guide for the wine market for the model selection and shed light on guiding further exploration regarding to wine quality prediction.\",\n",

Integrating metasurfaces with transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers provides additional functionality to ultrathin optics, such as tunable optical properties and enhanced light-matter interaction. Here, we developed a novel fabrication method that allows to directly integrate such a monolayer with a plasmonic lattice without compromising optical quality or coupling strength, by embedding the gold nanodisk array into an encapsulating hBN layer. We demonstrate plasmon-exciton-polaritons in this metasurface with a large Rabi splitting and strongly modified polarization and emission characteristics, as compared to a bare monolayer, achieving narrow-angle, directional, linearly polarized emission.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Predictive coding is a prominent theoretical framework for understanding the hierarchical sensory processing in the brain, yet how it could be implemented in networks of cortical neurons is still unclear. While most existing works have taken a hand-wiring approach to creating microcircuits that match experimental results, recent work in applying an optimisation approach to rate-based artificial neural networks revealed that cortical connectivity might result from self-organisation given some fundamental computational principle, such as energy efficiency. As no corresponding approach has studied this in more plausible networks of spiking neurons, we here investigate whether predictive coding properties in a multi-compartment spiking neural network can emerge from energy optimisation. We find that a model trained with an energy objective in addition to a task-relevant objective is able to reconstruct internal representations given top-down expectation signals alone. Additionally, neurons in the energy-optimised model also show differential responses to expected versus unexpected stimuli, qualitatively similar to experimental evidence for predictive coding. These findings indicate that predictive-coding-like behaviour might be an emergent property of energy optimisation, providing a new perspective on how predictive coding could be achieved in the cortex.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The efficient and precise identification of cracks in masonry stone structures caused by natural or human-induced factors within a specific region holds significant importance in detecting damage and subsequent secondary harm. In recent times, remote sensing technologies have been actively employed to promptly identify crack regions during repair and reinforcement activities. Enhanced image resolution has enabled more accurate and sensitive detection of these areas. This research presents a novel approach utilizing deep learning techniques for crack area detection in cellphone images, achieved through segmentation and object detection methods. The developed model, named the CAM-K-SEG segmentation model, combines Grad-CAM visualization and K-Mean clustering approaches with pre-trained convolutional neural network models. A comprehensive dataset comprising photographs of numerous historical buildings was utilized for training the model. To establish a comparative analysis, the widely used U-Net segmentation model was employed. The training and testing datasets for the developed technique were meticulously annotated and masked. The evaluation of the results was based on the Intersection-over-Union (IoU) metric values. Consequently, it was concluded that the CAM-K-SEG model exhibits suitability for object recognition and localization, whereas the U-Net model is well-suited for crack area segmentation.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Cavity-enhanced direct frequency comb spectroscopy (CE-DFCS) is widely used as a highly sensitive gas sensing technology in various gas detection fields. For the on-axis coupling incidence scheme, the detection accuracy and stability are seriously affected by the cavity-mode noise, and therefore, stable operation inevitably requires external electronic mode-locking and sweeping devices, substantially increasing system complexity. To address this issue, we propose off-axis cavity-enhanced optical frequency comb spectroscopy from both theoretical and experimental aspects, which is applied to the detection of single- and dual-gas of carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) in the near-infrared. An erbium-doped fiber frequency comb with a repetition frequency of \\u223c41.709 MHz is coupled into a resonant cavity with a length of \\u223c360 mm in an off-axis manner, exciting numerous high-order modes to effectively suppress cavity-mode noise. The performance of multiple machine learning models is compared for the inversion of a single/dual gas concentration. A few absorbance spectra are collected to build a sample data set, which is then utilized for model training and learning. The results demonstrate that the Particle Swarm Optimization Support Vector Machine (PSO-SVM) model achieves the highest predictive accuracy for gas concentration and is ultimately applied to the detection system. Based on Allan deviation, the detection limit for CO in single-gas detection can reach 8.247 parts per million by volume (ppmv) by averaging 87 spectra. Meanwhile, for simultaneous CO2/CO measurement with highly overlapping absorbance spectra, the LoD can be reduced to 13.196 and 4.658 ppmv, respectively. The proposed optical gas sensing technique indicates the potential for the development of a field-deployable and intelligent sensor system capable of simultaneous detection of multiple gases.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Simple Summary Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most common malignant primary brain tumors. The gold standard of cancer diagnosis relies on a medical technologist and a pathologist for feature-based analysis of hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides. To improve the efficiency of GBM diagnosis, an artificial intelligence model was built based on the TCGA-GBM dataset, and was deployed on an independent dataset collected locally. The support vector machine model showed excellent accuracy with very good sensitivity and specificity. It could potentially be used for GBM diagnosis and future clinical application. Abstract Background: Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most common malignant primary brain tumors, which accounts for 60\\u201370% of all gliomas. Conventional diagnosis and the decision of post-operation treatment plan for glioblastoma is mainly based on the feature-based qualitative analysis of hematoxylin and eosin-stained (H&E) histopathological slides by both an experienced medical technologist and a pathologist. The recent development of digital whole slide scanners makes AI-based histopathological image analysis feasible and helps to diagnose cancer by accurately counting cell types and/or quantitative analysis. However, the technology available for digital slide image analysis is still very limited. This study aimed to build an image feature-based computer model using histopathology whole slide images to differentiate patients with glioblastoma (GBM) from healthy control (HC). Method: Two independent cohorts of patients were used. The first cohort was composed of 262 GBM patients of the Cancer Genome Atlas Glioblastoma Multiform Collection (TCGA-GBM) dataset from the cancer imaging archive (TCIA) database. The second cohort was composed of 60 GBM patients collected from a local hospital. Also, a group of 60 participants with no known brain disease were collected. All the H&E slides were collected. Thirty-three image features (22 GLCM and 11 GLRLM) were retrieved from the tumor volume delineated by medical technologist on H&E slides. Five machine-learning algorithms including decision-tree (DT), extreme-boost (EB), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and linear model (LM) were used to build five models using the image features extracted from the first cohort of patients. Models built were deployed using the selected key image features for GBM diagnosis from the second cohort (local patients) as model testing, to identify and verify key image features for GBM diagnosis. Results: All five machine learning algorithms demonstrated excellent performance in GBM diagnosis and achieved an overall accuracy of 100% in the training and validation stage. A total of 12 GLCM and 3 GLRLM image features were identified and they showed a significant difference between the normal and the GBM image. However, only the SVM model maintained its excellent performance in the deployment of the models using the independent local cohort, with an accuracy of 93.5%, sensitivity of 86.95%, and specificity of 99.73%. Conclusion: In this study, we have identified 12 GLCM and 3 GLRLM image features which can aid the GBM diagnosis. Among the five models built, the SVM model proposed in this study demonstrated excellent accuracy with very good sensitivity and specificity. It could potentially be used for GBM diagnosis and future clinical application.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Abstract. Purpose Image-based prediction of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity and resource needs can be an important means to address the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we propose an artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) COVID-19 prognosis method to predict patients\\u2019 needs for intensive care by analyzing chest X-ray radiography (CXR) images using deep learning. Approach The dataset consisted of 8357 CXR exams from 5046 COVID-19\\u2013positive patients as confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for the SARS-CoV-2 virus with a training/validation/test split of 64%/16%/20% on a by patient level. Our model involved a DenseNet121 network with a sequential transfer learning technique employed to train on a sequence of gradually more specific and complex tasks: (1) fine-tuning a model pretrained on ImageNet using a previously established CXR dataset with a broad spectrum of pathologies; (2) refining on another established dataset to detect pneumonia; and (3) fine-tuning using our in-house training/validation datasets to predict patients\\u2019 needs for intensive care within 24, 48, 72, and 96 h following the CXR exams. The classification performances were evaluated on our independent test set (CXR exams of 1048 patients) using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) as the figure of merit in the task of distinguishing between those COVID-19\\u2013positive patients who required intensive care following the imaging exam and those who did not. Results Our proposed AI/ML model achieved an AUC (95% confidence interval) of 0.78 (0.74, 0.81) when predicting the need for intensive care 24 h in advance, and at least 0.76 (0.73, 0.80) for 48 h or more in advance using predictions based on the AI prognostic marker derived from CXR images. Conclusions This AI/ML prediction model for patients\\u2019 needs for intensive care has the potential to support both clinical decision-making and resource management.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the realm of criminal defense introduces the potential for innovative transformations within the judicial system, albeit accompanied by a series of intricate and significant challenges. This paper encapsulates the primary challenges faced by AI in criminal defense. Initially, technical challenges encompass data privacy and security, algorithmic transparency and fairness, and model interpretability. Secondly, ethical issues involve the moral guidelines of AI adjudications and its impact on human rights and social justice. Thirdly, legal challenges include the legitimacy and reliability of evidence, and the regulation of AI decision-making within the legal framework. Lastly, the application of AI may also induce an evolution in the roles of legal practitioners, thereby redefining their function within judicial processes. In essence, the development of AI in the field of criminal defense necessitates a holistic consideration of these challenges and the formulation of corresponding strategies to ensure its application is both effective and equitable, while aligning with legal and ethical values. The significance of this research lies in providing innovative and improvement opportunities for the judicial system by exploring the application of AI in the field of criminal defense and the challenges it faces, while also confronting the challenges brought about by new technologies and actively seeking solutions to ensure that the application of AI in criminal defense can fully unleash its potential while adhering to legal, ethical, and societal norms.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Hydraulic systems are used in all kinds of industries. Mills, manufacturing, robotics, and Ports require the use of Hydraulic Equipment. Many industries prefer to use hydraulic systems due to their numerous advantages over electrical and mechanical systems. Hence, the growth in demand for hydraulic systems has been increasing over time. Due to its vast variety of applications, the faults in hydraulic systems can cause a breakdown. Using Artificial-Intelligence (AI)-based approaches, faults can be classified and predicted to avoid downtime and ensure sustainable operations. This research work proposes a novel approach for the classification of the cooling behavior of a hydraulic test rig. Three fault conditions for the cooling system of the hydraulic test rig were used. The spectrograms were generated using the time series data for three fault conditions. The CNN variant, the Residual Network, was used for the classification of the fault conditions. Various features were extracted from the data including the F-score, precision, accuracy, and recall using a Confusion Matrix. The data contained 43,680 attributes and 2205 instances. After testing, validating, and training, the model accuracy of the ResNet-18 architecture was found to be close to 95%.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) are widely recognized as a potential solution to achieve ubiquitous connections of Narrow Bandwidth Internet of Things (NB-IoT). In order to adopt NTNs in NB-IoT, one of the main challenges is the uplink synchronization of Narrowband Physical Random Access procedure which refers to the estimation of time of arrival (ToA) and carrier frequency offset (CFO). Due to the large propagation delay and Doppler shift in NTNs, traditional estimation methods for Terrestrial Networks (TNs) can not be applied in NTNs directly. In this context, we design a two stage ToA and CFO estimation scheme including coarse estimation and fine estimation based on abrupt change point detection (CPD) of phase series with machine learning. Our method achieves high estimation accuracy of ToA and CFO under the low signal-noise ratio (SNR) and large Doppler shift conditions and extends the estimation range without enhancing Random Access preambles.\",\n",

Discrimination was 0.83 (95% CI 0.71 to 0.90) for bacterial pneumonia, with moderate calibration and 0.67 (0.61 to 0.72) for other SBIs, with poor calibration. After model re-fitting, discrimination improved to 0.88 (0.79 to 0.96) and 0.71 (0.65 to 0.76) and calibration improved. Predicted risk <1% ruled out bacterial pneumonia with sensitivity 0.95 (0.86 to 1.00) and negative likelihood ratio (LR) 0.09 (0.00 to 0.32). Predicted risk >10% ruled in bacterial pneumonia with specificity 0.91 (0.88 to 0.94) and positive LR 6.51 (3.71 to 10.3). Predicted risk <10% ruled out other SBIs with sensitivity 0.92 (0.87 to 0.97) and negative LR 0.32 (0.13 to 0.57). Predicted risk >30% ruled in other SBIs with specificity 0.89 (0.86 to 0.92) and positive LR 2.86 (1.91 to 4.25). Conclusion Discrimination and calibration were good for bacterial pneumonia but poorer for other SBIs. The rule-out thresholds have the potential to reduce unnecessary investigations and antibiotics in this high-risk group.\",\n",

In the market, there is competition for better management, higher evaluation quality, and improved facilities. The sole means of accomplish all of these traits is to carry out data examination with greater accuracy and purity. With the use of existing data, machine learning helps to predict future outcomes so that decisions can be improved. Cricket is a popular sport that is played and viewed throughout worldwide. Many of these cricket supporters hope that their team will perform well and get the victory. Teams should improve their individual and team performances if they want to win. The ability to envisage the winner of a test match is affected by a variety of variables, including team strengths, ground and weather. A detailed investigation has been used to anticipate the game\\u2019s match winner through several criteria that have been examined in this paper. This paper discusses guessing the champion of a cricket competition before it began. Different machine learning methods, including Random Forest, SVM, and Decision Tree, have been applied to test and learning information set of various size for this model-building purpose. The predictive algorithm will be useful for the International Cricket Council in terms of cricket analysis and team strength evaluation. This model will help the implementations for betting and tournament media.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that collaboratively learns a global model by multiple clients with data privacy-preserving. Although many FL algorithms have been proposed for classification tasks, few works focus on more challenging semantic segmentation tasks, especially in the class-heterogeneous FL situation. Compared with classification, the issues from heterogeneous FL for semantic segmentation are more severe: (1) Due to the non-IID distribution, different clients may contain inconsistent foreground-background classes, resulting in divergent local updates. (2) Class-heterogeneity for complex dense prediction tasks makes the local optimum of clients farther from the global optimum. In this work, we propose FedSeg, a basic federated learning approach for class-heterogeneous semantic segmentation. We first propose a simple but strong modified cross-entropy loss to correct the local optimization and address the foreground-background inconsistency problem. Based on it, we introduce pixel-level contrastive learning to enforce local pixel embeddings belonging to the global semantic space. Extensive experiments on four semantic segmentation benchmarks (Cityscapes, CamVID, PascalVOC and ADE20k) demonstrate the effectiveness of our FedSeg. We hope this work will attract more attention from the FL community to the challenging semantic segmentation federated learning.\",\n",

Thus, it is essential to guarantee that consumers receive a steady and consistent power supply. But because solar energy data is erratic, simple statistical and machine learning techniques are unreliable for predicting. Performance evaluation criteria, weather classification, predicting horizon, and other aspects all affect how well solar irradiance performs. As a result, it offers research on models for forecasting solar irradiance that use shallow neural networks. More than a thousand records of solar energy output are included in the dataset, together with meteorological data covering a full year. Various indicators are used to evaluate these models' performance. The model of the type that was chosen has a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.24 and a mean square error (MSE) of 0.14.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Previous raw image-based low-light image enhancement methods predominantly relied on feed-forward neural networks to learn deterministic mappings from low-light to normally-exposed images. However, they failed to capture critical distribution information, leading to visually undesirable results. This work addresses the issue by seamlessly integrating a diffusion model with a physics-based exposure model. Different from a vanilla diffusion model that has to perform Gaussian denoising, with the injected physics-based exposure model, our restoration process can directly start from a noisy image instead of pure noise. As such, our method obtains significantly improved performance and reduced inference time compared with vanilla diffusion models. To make full use of the advantages of different intermediate steps, we further propose an adaptive residual layer that effectively screens out the side-effect in the iterative refinement when the intermediate results have been already well-exposed. The proposed framework can work with both real-paired datasets, SOTA noise models, and different backbone networks. We evaluate the proposed method on various public benchmarks, achieving promising results with consistent improvements using different exposure models and backbones. Besides, the proposed method achieves better generalization capacity for unseen amplifying ratios and better performance than a larger feedforward neural model when few parameters are adopted.

      "      \"abstract\": \"Simple Summary Skin cancer is a major concern worldwide, and accurately identifying it is crucial for effective treatment. we propose a modified deep learning model called SBXception, based on the Xception network, to improve skin cancer classification. Using the HAM10000 dataset, consisting of 10,015 skin lesion images, the model achieved an impressive accuracy on a test set. SBXception also showed significant improvements, requiring fewer parameters and reducing training time compared to the original model. This study highlights the potential of modified deep learning models in enhancing skin cancer diagnosis, benefiting society by improving treatment outcomes. Abstract Skin cancer is a major public health concern around the world. Skin cancer identification is critical for effective treatment and improved results. Deep learning models have shown considerable promise in assisting dermatologists in skin cancer diagnosis. This study proposes SBXception: a shallower and broader variant of the Xception network. It uses Xception as the base model for skin cancer classification and increases its performance by reducing the depth and expanding the breadth of the architecture. We used the HAM10000 dataset, which contains 10,015 dermatoscopic images of skin lesions classified into seven categories, for training and testing the proposed model. Using the HAM10000 dataset, we fine-tuned the new model and reached an accuracy of 96.97% on a holdout test set. SBXception also achieved significant performance enhancement with 54.27% fewer training parameters and reduced training time compared to the base model. Our findings show that reducing and expanding the Xception model architecture can greatly improve its performance in skin cancer categorization.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Background: Early recognition of the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) may improve clinical outcomes. The main objective of this study was to identify proteomic biomarkers and develop an early prediction model for CPB-ARDS. Methods: The authors conducted three prospective nested cohort studies of all consecutive patients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB at Union Hospital of Tongji Medical College Hospital. Plasma proteomic profiling was performed in ARDS patients and matched controls (Cohort 1, April 2021\\u2013July 2021) at multiple timepoints: before CPB (T1), at the end of CPB (T2), and 24 h after CPB (T3). Then, for Cohort 2 (August 2021\\u2013July 2022), biomarker expression was measured and verified in the plasma. Furthermore, lung ischemia/reperfusion injury (LIRI) models and sham-operation were established in 50 rats to explore the tissue-level expression of biomarkers identified in the aforementioned clinical cohort. Subsequently, a machine learning-based prediction model incorporating protein and clinical predictors from Cohort 2 for CPB-ARDS was developed and internally validated. Model performance was externally validated on Cohort 3 (January 2023\\u2013March 2023). Results: A total of 709 proteins were identified, with 9, 29, and 35 altered proteins between ARDS cases and controls at T1, T2, and T3, respectively, in Cohort 1. Following quantitative verification of several predictive proteins in Cohort 2, higher levels of thioredoxin domain containing 5 (TXNDC5), cathepsin L (CTSL), and NPC intracellular cholesterol transporter 2 (NPC2) at T2 were observed in CPB-ARDS patients. A dynamic online predictive nomogram was developed based on three proteins (TXNDC5, CTSL, and NPC2) and two clinical risk factors (CPB time and massive blood transfusion), with excellent performance (precision: 83.33%, sensitivity: 93.33%, specificity: 61.16%, and F1 score: 85.05%). The mean area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of the model after 10-fold cross-validation was 0.839 (95% CI: 0.824\\u20130.855). Model discrimination and calibration were maintained during external validation dataset testing, with an AUC of 0.820 (95% CI: 0.685\\u20130.955) and a Brier Score of 0.177 (95% CI: 0.147\\u20130.206). Moreover, the considerably overexpressed TXNDC5 and CTSL proteins identified in the plasma of patients with CPB-ARDS, exhibited a significant upregulation in the lung tissue of LIRI rats. Conclusions: This study identified several novel predictive biomarkers, developed and validated a practical prediction tool using biomarker and clinical factor combinations for individual prediction of CPB-ARDS risk. Assessing the plasma TXNDC5, CTSL, and NPC2 levels might identify patients who warrant closer follow-up and intensified therapy for ARDS prevention following major surgery.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Driving is a complex task involving the perception of the driving event, planning response, and action. Safe driving ensures the vehicle\\u2019s and its passengers\\u2019 safety, whereas economical driving brings down fuel consumption. Eventually, eco-safe driving that ensures economical as well as safe driving is the best bet. This review paper provides a systematic comprehensive analysis across cross-cutting dimensions such as data collection mechanisms, features affecting eco-safe driving, computational models for driving behavior analysis, driver motivational approaches towards eco-safe driving, exploiting research gaps and opportunities for further research in this domain. Driving behavior along with environmental context, including weather information, road conditions, traffic flow and time of travel, represent the most effective factors for doing eco-safe driving analysis. 82% of reviewed papers recommended OBD as a reliable data collection source, along with supplementary information from body sensors and cameras. The K-Mean clustering is an effective driving profiling technique clubbed with dimensionality reduction techniques based on Random Forest regressor, PCA and autoencoders. Deep learning and ensemble learning-based safety approaches utilizing Recurrent Convolutional Networks (RCN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Decision Tree (DT) have achieved impressive accuracies surpassing 99%, followed by Neural Networks (NN), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) with accuracy ranging from 91% to 96%. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) yielded superior Area Under Curve (AUC of 0.836) for fuel prediction, in comparison to Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Neural Networks (NN). Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) represents fine-grained accurate fuel-prediction methods with accuracy comparable to Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Prominent research gaps identified during this study are the lack of a comprehensive approach covering all aspects related to safety, fuel economy, the scope of improvement in real-time driving risk assessment at appropriate granularity level, missing effective and engaging driving feedback, dealing with uncertain and incomplete driving events, driver\\u2019s personal traits affecting driving safety and fuel-economy. The review will help in establishing the readiness of automation of driving analysis for reinforcement of eco-safe driving for various kinds of vehicles plug-in hybrid vehicles, hybrid electric vehicles, electric vehicles, and self-driving cars.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Despite the impressive results achieved by deep learning based 3D reconstruction, the techniques of directly learning to model 4D human captures with detailed geometry have been less studied. This work presents a novel neural compositional representation for Human 4D Modeling with transformER (H4MER). Specifically, our H4MER is a compact and compositional representation for dynamic human by exploiting the human body prior from the widely used SMPL parametric model. Thus, H4MER can represent a dynamic 3D human over a temporal span with the codes of shape, initial pose, motion and auxiliaries. A simple yet effective linear motion model is proposed to provide a rough and regularized motion estimation, followed by per-frame compensation for pose and geometry details with the residual encoded in the auxiliary codes. We present a novel Transformer-based feature extractor and conditional GRU decoder to facilitate learning and improve the representation capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method is not only effective in recovering dynamic human with accurate motion and detailed geometry, but also amenable to various 4D human related tasks, including monocular video fitting, motion retargeting, 4D completion, and future prediction.\",\n",

First, the features extracted from the text are too sparse. Second, the similarity matrices of each different modality cannot be fused adaptively. In this paper, we propose Deep Enhanced-Similarity Attention Hashing (DESAH) to alleviate the above problems. Firstly, we construct a text encoder expanding graph convolutional neural network to simultaneously extract features of samples and their semantic neighbors to enrich text features. Secondly, we propose an enhanced attention fusion mechanism. The mechanism is used to adaptively fuse the similarity matrices within different modalities to form a unified inter-modal similarity matrix to guide the learning of hash functions. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that DESAH provides significant improvements in cross-modal retrieval tasks compared to baseline methods.\",\n",

By engaging in profound learning of the error data from the past three days, the Transformer model offers an in-depth perception and understanding of the evolutionary patterns within the SST error data. Utilizing this advanced machine learning approach, the model successfully predicts the SST errors for the subsequent three days, significantly enhancing the prediction capability of the numerical model at the hourly scale. Experimental results further corroborate that the Transformer model demonstrates exceptional correction performance in machine learning across different time intervals such as 3 hours, 6 hours, and 24 hours.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"There are many sounds all around us and our brain can easily and clearly identify them. Furthermore, our brain processes the received sound signals continuously and provides us with relevant environmental knowledge. Although not up to the level of accuracy of the brain, there are some smart devices which can extract necessary information from an audio signal with the help of different algorithms. Over the years, various models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Region- Convolutional Neural Networks (R-CNNs), and numerous machine learning techniques have been employed for sound classification. These methods have shown impressive results in distinguishing spectra-temporal patterns and different sound categories. The novelty of our research lies in showing that the long-short term memory (LSTM) shows a better result in classification accuracy compared to CNN for many features used. Additionally, we've evaluated model accuracy using different techniques such as data augmentation and feature stacking. With our RNN model, we achieved a remarkable accuracy of 87%, setting a new benchmark in performance on the UrbanSound8k dataset. Our findings not only advance the field of sound classification but also underscore the potential of LSTM networks and the importance of innovative techniques such as data augmentation and feature stacking in improving the accuracy of sound recognition systems.

AI machines can now imitate some of the outputs of our form of sapience; they can produce literary and artistic content and even express what seem like feelings and emotions. Calls for \\u201crobot rights\\u201d are getting louder. Using a transdisciplinary methodology, including philosophy of mind, moral philosophy, linguistics and neuroscience, this essay aims to situate the difference in law between human and machine in a way that a court of law could operationalize. This is not a purely theoretical exercise. Courts have already started to make that distinction and making it correctly will likely become gradually more important, as humans become more like machines (cyborgs, cobots) and machines more like humans (neural networks, robots with biological material). The essay draws a line that separates human and machine using the way in which humans think, a way that machines may mimic and possibly emulate but are unlikely ever to make their own.\\n\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Bug reproduction is a critical task in software testing, as it helps developers to identify and fix bugs in the software. While some automated reproduction tools are designed to assist developers in reproducing bugs detected by automated testing tools, they are not entirely reliable. Thus, manual reproduction remains important. However, automated testing tools often generate testing results that are difficult for non-professional developers to understand, which complicates their efforts to reproduce bugs. In this paper, we propose RepAssistor, an approach that employs an interactive method to assist developers in reproducing bugs based on automated testing logs. RepAssistor is designed for reproducing bugs in mobile applications. It leverages deep learning (DL) and traditional computer vision (CV) techniques to analyze application screenshots, transforming automated testing logs into a graph representation. In this graph, edges represent test events while nodes represent application states. With this graph representation in place, RepAssistor is then able to monitor developers\\u2019 actions and continuously track which node they are at in this graph in real-time. Based on this understanding, RepAssistor dynamically calculates and updates the optimal path to guide developers to reproduce bugs. This guidance is conveyed to the developers through an interactive method, enabling effective communication and assistance throughout the bug reproduction process. Our experiments demonstrate that RepAssistor improves the performance of developers in bug reproduction tasks.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Introduction Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) belong to the syndecan family, and syndecan-1 (CD138) is a heparan sulfate proteoglycan. Syndecan-1 has a potential role in cell-matrix and cell-cell communications as they are present in cell epithelium. Its expression is different in an extensive range of benign, inflammatory, and neoplastic diseases. In routine histopathology, it is used as a marker for plasma cells. However, it is expressed in a large variety of normal and neoplastic epithelia including squamous epithelium and gastric glandular epithelium expressed in other tissues, i.e., the liver. In the liver, variable expression is seen in cirrhosis, hepatitis, and carcinoma. The objective of this study was to investigate the expression of this marker in normal, inflammatory, and neoplastic lesions of the liver. This in turn may help clinicians to select patients who may benefit from anti-CD138 therapy. It is currently used in the diagnosis and management of plasma cell proliferations. Material and methods This is a retrospective study in which we retrieved 53 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) liver specimen blocks and selected one block from each case by reviewing the hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) slides of each case. Syndecan-1 (CD138), pancytokeratin, and CD68 expression were analyzed immunohistochemically (IHC) to evaluate the percentage and intensity of CD138 expression in various hepatic entities and identify those entities where syndecan-1 can be consistently used to make a definitive diagnosis. Results The expression of pancytokeratin and CD68 was analyzed in hepatocytes and Kupffer cells, respectively. For syndecan-1 (CD138), 15.4% of cases showed basolateral membranous positivity, 44.6% of cases showed complete membranous positivity, and 40% of cases showed no positivity in hepatocytes. Cytokeratin (CK) was positive as expected in hepatocytes, and CD68 was expressed in Kupffer cells. Conclusion CD138 does not appear to be a reliable surrogate marker for liver disease. However, it may be included with other ancillary markers as a predictor of the stage of chronic liver disease and metastatic potential. The response to anti-CD138 therapy needs to be further studied.\",\n",

      "      \"title\": \"LMD: Light-weight Prediction Quality Estimation for Object Detection in Lidar Point Clouds\",\n",
      "      \"abstract\": \"Object detection on Lidar point cloud data is a promising technology for autonomous driving and robotics which has seen a significant rise in performance and accuracy during recent years. Particularly uncertainty estimation is a crucial component for down-stream tasks and deep neural networks remain error-prone even for predictions with high confidence. Previously proposed methods for quantifying prediction uncertainty tend to alter the training scheme of the detector or rely on prediction sampling which results in vastly increased inference time. In order to address these two issues, we propose LidarMetaDetect (LMD), a light-weight post-processing scheme for prediction quality estimation. Our method can easily be added to any pre-trained Lidar object detector without altering anything about the base model and is purely based on post-processing, therefore, only leading to a negligible computational overhead. Our experiments show a significant increase of statistical reliability in separating true from false predictions. We propose and evaluate an additional application of our method leading to the detection of annotation errors. Explicit samples and a conservative count of annotation error proposals indicates the viability of our method for large-scale datasets like KITTI and nuScenes. On the widely-used nuScenes test dataset, 43 out of the top 100 proposals of our method indicate, in fact, erroneous annotations.\",\n",

The system takes raspberry pie as the main control module, according to the real-time weather forecast data of the current area obtained through WI-FI, and combined with the real-time monitoring of soil moisture by the soil moisture information collection module, the BP neural network model is used to intelligently judge whether irrigation is needed and automatically output the amount of water needed for irrigation. The test results of the system show that the predicted value of crop water demand based on BP neural network almost coincides with the expected value, indicating that the system can effectively and accurately predict crop water demand, and all kinds of modules controlled by raspberry pie can be combined organically, and the system is easy to operate, stable and reliable, and can provide optimal precision irrigation for crops. The system ensures the best growth of crops with the minimum amount of irrigation water, provides targeting and refinement for modern agriculture, effectively improves the utilization rate of water resources, has strong practicability, and has strong application value in agricultural production.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Heterogeneous face recognition (HFR) involves the intricate task of matching face images across the visual domains of visible (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR). While much of the existing literature on HFR identifies the domain gap as a primary challenge and directs efforts towards bridging it at either the input or feature level, our work deviates from this trend. We observe that large neural networks, unlike their smaller counterparts, when pre-trained on large scale homogeneous VIS data, demonstrate exceptional zero-shot performance in HFR, suggesting that the domain gap might be less pronounced than previously believed. By approaching the HFR problem as one of low-data fine-tuning, we introduce a straightforward framework: comprehensive pre-training, succeeded by a regularized fine-tuning strategy, that matches or surpasses the current state-of-the-art on four publicly available benchmarks.

Distribution equipment is at the bottom of the power system, which is the part closest to users. Whether it can run safely, stably and reliably directly affects the quality of power supply for users. With the rapid growth of smart grid construction, the number of real-time data analysis in power grid is also increasing. It is a very arduous task to analyze, process, allocate, manage and comprehensively control a large number of electric energy resources and ensure the safe and efficient implementation of electric power production. In this paper, a method of distribution network data collection and management based on back propagation neural network (BPNN) algorithm and map technology is proposed, which provides theoretical and data support for the optimization of distribution network data management mode. The experimental results show that, compared with ID3 algorithm, BPNN has obvious advantages in the later stage of operation, and the error is reduced by 30.78%. By comparing the evaluation results of this model with ID3 algorithm, it is proved that this model is effective and feasible.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Volcanic eruptions are a natural hazard that can devastate people and property. In recent years, the number of volcanic eruptions has been on the rise, and the effects of climate change are making them more frequent and more powerful. This research proposes a new methodology for monitoring volcanoes in real-time or very close to real-time using an intelligent Distributed Satellite System (iDSS). The iDSS is made up of a constellation of satellites that are all connected to one another by means of Inter-Satellite Links (ISL). This allows the data to be processed and distributed in real-time, which is essential for early warning of volcanic eruptions. In previous studies, the on-board volcanic eruption detection was proven to be possible and feasible by utilising appropriate Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. Multispectral optical data were used to assess if an active volcanic eruption was captured in the image. The proposed iDSS architecture is practical and can be used to monitor volcanoes in real-time or near real-time. The system has been tested by taking Mount Etna as a case study and the results have been reported. The findings and conclusions of this research can be applied to and expanded upon in the context of similar natural disasters occurring around the globe.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Artificial one- and two-dimensional lattices have emerged as a powerful platform for the emulation of lattice Hamiltonians, the fundamental study of collective many-body effects as well as phenomena arising from non-trivial topology. Exciton-polaritons, bosonic part-light and part-matter quasiparticles, combine pronounced nonlinearities with the possibility of on-chip implementation. In this context, organic semiconductors, hosting ultra-stable Frenkel excitons, embedded in a microcavity have proven to be versatile contenders for the study of nonlinear many-body physics and bosonic condensation, which also enable deployment at ambient conditions. Here, we implement a well-controlled, high-quality optical lattice, hosting light-matter quasi-particles. The realized polariton graphene presents with excellent cavity quality factors, showing distinct signatures of Dirac cone and flatband dispersions as well as polariton lasing at room temperature. This is realized by filling coupled dielectric microcavities with the fluorescent protein mCherry. We demonstrate the emergence of a coherent polariton condensate at ambient conditions, profiting from coupling conditions as precise and controllable as in state-of-the-art inorganic semiconductor-based systems, without limitations due to e.g. lattice matching in epitaxial growth. This progress allows straightforward extension to more complex systems, such as the study of topological phenomena in two-dimensional lattices including topological lasers and non-Hermitian optics.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The target of this research is to evaluate the images classification and detection of cyanosis on lightly and darkly individual human skins using two popular models, simple convolutional neural network (CNN) and Fine-tuned VGG16 in deep neural network TensorFlow's Keras API; and compare the performance of both models based on images that were not incorporated in ImageNet library dataset and data augmentation. Cyanosis is the abnormal bluish stain of skin due to poor circulation or lack of oxygen (the word cyanosis originated from the colour name cyan, which is etymologically derived from the Greek term \\u201ckyanos\\u201c meaning \\u201cblue\\u201d). Peripheral and central cyanosis is indicated by the purple or bluish tint of the feet, face, and hands. The fine-tuned VGG16 model has demonstrated emphatic categorical validation accuracy (82%) than the simple CNN model (79%). On the other hand, the simple CNN model took less time (7.733 minutes) to train on the images that were not incorporated in the ImageNet library than fine-tuned VGG16 model (24.63 minutes). With the limitations of in-vivo and in-silico experiments on the classification and detection of the darkly pigmented individual human skins, it will be veritably beneficial for the dermatologist to apply a deep neural network to prognosis and classify and detect cyanosis in individual human skins at its early stage.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The major goal is to create opportunities for deep learning algorithms to be used to understand better and diagnose Parkinson's disease. The loss of dopamine-producing neurons causes Parkinson's disease, a degenerative disorder. When the condition first manifests, patients have tremors, bradykinesia, poor posture, and balance among other mobility impairments that progressively get worse over time. Additionally, as the global ageing population grows exponentially, more people are developing Parkinson's disease, which places a significant financial strain on governments. Structural modifications in the brain of individuals suffering from Parkinson's disease, resulting from a deficiency in dopamine, can be visualized through the application of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). In this particular investigation, an attempt was made to classify MR images of both Parkinson's disease patients and unaffected individuals by utilizing a sophisticated deep learning neural network. The utilization of a convolutional neural network proves to be instrumental in augmenting the diagnostic capabilities concerning Parkinson's disease. The MR images are meticulously scrutinized and subjected to rigorous evaluation in order to derive accurate metrics pertaining to their classification. The primary objective of this investigation aims to establish an approach for accurately discerning and classifying ailments through the utilization of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Deep learning exhibits remarkable proficiency in disease diagnosis and image interpretation. A burgeoning body of scholarly inquiry suggests that the identification and prognostication of Parkinson's disease may necessitate the application of deep learning methodologies. In terms of disease prediction, deep learning models wield immense potency. The best early detection accuracy deep learning algorithms are hence the subject of increased research. In this experiment, the illness stage will be determined by brain imaging. Also, to the study suggests an effective deep learning approach for early disease prediction utilizing MRI data. The data set came from Kaggle. In this article a deep learning method for diagnosing Parkinson's diseases is proposed that makes use of the CNN algorithm.\",\n",

Deep learning based U-Net architecture is proposed to estimate the linear trajectory parameters.

Here, we test a protein design pipeline that uses iterative rounds of deep learning (DL)-based structure prediction (AlphaFold2) and sequence optimization (ProteinMPNN) to design autoinhibitory domains (AiDs) for a PD-L1 antagonist. With the goal of creating an anticancer agent that is inactive until reaching the tumor environment, we sought to create autoinhibited (or masked) forms of the PD-L1 antagonist that can be unmasked by tumor-enriched proteases. Twenty-three de novo designed AiDs, varying in length and topology, were fused to the antagonist with a protease-sensitive linker, and binding to PD-L1 was measured with and without protease treatment. Nine of the fusion proteins demonstrated conditional binding to PD-L1, and the top-performing AiDs were selected for further characterization as single-domain proteins. Without any experimental affinity maturation, four of the AiDs bind to the PD-L1 antagonist with equilibrium dissociation constants (KDs) below 150 nM, with the lowest KD equal to 0.9 nM. Our study demonstrates that DL-based protein modeling can be used to rapidly generate high-affinity protein binders.\",\n",

The aim of this study was to identify and quantify the circumstances contributing to medically attended paediatric fall injuries among 0\\u20134\\u2009years old. Methods Cross-sectional data for falls among kids under 5 years recorded between 2012 and 2016 in the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System was obtained. A sample of 4546 narratives was manually coded for: (1) where the child fell from; (2) what the child fell onto; (3) the activities preceding the fall and (4) how the fall occurred. A natural language processing model was developed and subsequently applied to the remaining uncoded data to yield a set of 91\\u2009325 cases coded for what the child fell from, fell onto, the activities preceding the fall, and how the fall occurred. Data were descriptively tabulated by age and disposition. Results Children most often fell from the bed accounting for one-third (33%) of fall injuries in infants, 13% in toddlers and 12% in preschoolers. Children were more likely to be hospitalised if they fell from another person (7.4% vs 2.6% for all other sources; p<0.01). After adjusting for age, the odds of a child being hospitalised following a fall from another person were 2.1 times higher than falling from other surfaces (95%\\u2009CI 1.6 to 2.7). Conclusions The prevalence of injuries due to falling off the bed, and the elevated risk of serious injury from falling from another person highlights the need for more robust and effective communication to caregivers on fall injury prevention.\",\n",

The research aims at development of a functional milk drink enriched with iron (II) ascorbate\\u2013isoleucinate. The thesis presents the study results of a triple chelate complex \\u2013 iron (II) ascorbate isoleucinate. Based on its optical properties research by spectrophotometry, the authors revealed that there was a 557 nm band in the absorption spectrum of the sample, which stood for the complex characteristic of iron, ascorbic acid and L-isoleucine. The thesis consists of the study results of the iron ions chelation mechanism by vitamin C and amino acid. The most energetically advantageous configuration is the interaction through hydroxyl groups of ascorbic acid attached to carbon atoms C2 and C3. The infrared spectroscopy results confirm the data obtained. The iron ions interaction with ascorbic acid and L-isoleucine is accompanied by the Fe\\u2013O and Fe\\u2013N bonds formation. The authors studied the aggregative stability of the triple complex samples; processed experimental data using neural networks and machine learning; obtained ternary surfaces describing the mutual factors impact on the output parameter \\u2013 the change in optical density. At the maximum mixing time, there is the triple complex destruction accompanied by a significant increase in optical density. In an alkaline medium at room temperature and minimal mixing time, there is a moderate change in the optical density characterized by the stability of iron (II) ascorbate isoleucinate. At the final stage, a man produced milk samples enriched with a triple iron complex, and studied the antioxidant activity of the obtained products. As a result, the complex introduction enables to increase the total antioxidant activity of milk by 40%.\",\n",

This technique combines adaptive probability learning and waveform decomposition to optimize the similarity of features. Its objective is to discover the most appropriate linear mapping between simulated and real data to minimize distribution differences. By aligning the data in the same feature space, the proposed method effectively overcomes the challenge posed by limited sample size when identifying faults and classifying real data in distribution networks. Experimental results utilizing simulated system data and real field data demonstrate that this approach outperforms commonly used classification models such as convolutional neural networks, support vector machines, and k-nearest neighbors, especially under adaptive learning conditions. Consequently, this research provides a fresh perspective on fault detection in distribution networks, particularly when adaptive learning conditions are employed.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"\\n Introduction:\\n While previous studies have reported associations of pericardial adipose tissue (PAT) with cardiovascular diseases such as atrial fibrillation (AF) and coronary artery disease (CAD), they have been limited in sample size or drawn from selected populations. Additionally, the genetic determinants of PAT remain largely unknown.\\n \\n \\n Hypothesis:\\n PAT is associated with cardiovascular diseases and genetic loci influence variation in PAT.\\n \\n \\n Methods:\\n A deep learning model was trained to quantify PAT area from four-chamber CMR images in the UK Biobank using semantic segmentation. Cross-sectional and prospective cardiovascular disease associations were evaluated, controlling for sex and age. A genome-wide association study was performed, and a polygenic score (PGS) for PAT was examined in 453,733 independent FinnGen study participants.\\n \\n \\n Results:\\n A total of 44,725 UK Biobank participants (51.7% female, mean [SD] age 64.1 [7.7] years) were included. PAT was positively associated with male sex (\\u03b2 = +0.76 SD in PAT), age (r = 0.15), body mass index (BMI; r = 0.47) and waist-to-hip ratio (r = 0.55) (P < 1x10\\n -230\\n for all). PAT was more elevated in prevalent heart failure (\\u03b2 = +0.46 SD units) and type 2 diabetes (T2D; \\u03b2 = +0.56) than in CAD (\\u03b2 = +0.22) or AF (\\u03b2 = +0.18). Baseline PAT was associated with incident heart failure (HR = 1.29 per +1 SD in PAT [95% CI 1.17-1.43]) and T2D (HR = 1.63 [1.51-1.76]) during mean (SD) 3.2 (1.5) years of follow-up; the associations remained significant when controlling for BMI. We replicated 2/2 known genetic loci and identified 5 novel loci, implicating transcriptional regulators of adipocyte morphology and brown adipogenesis (\\n EBF1\\n ,\\n EBF2\\n and\\n CEBPA\\n ) and regulators of visceral adiposity (\\n WARS2\\n and\\n TRIB2\\n ). The PAT PGS was associated with T2D, HF, CAD and AF in FinnGen (ORs 1.03-1.06 per +1 SD in PGS, P < 2x10\\n -10\\n for all).\\n \\n \\n Conclusions:\\n PAT shares genetic determinants with abdominal obesity and is an independent predictor of incident T2D and heart failure.\\n \\n \\n \\n\",\n",

This study aims to explore trends in this area through a bibliometric analysis. A Random Forest Model was utilized to identify keywords and other metadata that predict average citations in the field. To supplement this machine learning analysis, we have also implemented a bibliometric review of the corpus. Our findings reveal significant positive coefficients for the keywords \\u201cCOVID-19\\u201d and \\u201cMale\\u201d, underscoring the influence of the pandemic and potential gender-related factors in the literature. On the other hand, the keyword \\u201cFemale\\u201d showed a negative coefficient, hinting at possible disparities that warrant further investigation. Additionally, evolving themes such as COVID-19, mental health, and social media were discovered. A significant change was observed in the main publishing journals, while the major contributing authors remained the same. The results hint at the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic and a significant association between gender-related keywords on citation likelihood, as well as changing publication strategies, despite the fact that the main researchers remain those who have been studying health literacy since its creation.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Protein engineering is essential for a variety of applications, such as designing biologic drugs, optimizing enzymes, and developing novel functional molecules. Accurate protein fitness landscape modeling, such as predicting protein properties in sequence space, is critical for efficient protein engineering. Yet, due to the complexity of the landscape and high-dimensional sequence space, it remains as an unsolved problem. In this work, we present \\u00b5Former, a deep learning framework that combines a pre-trained protein language model with three scoring modules targeting protein features at multiple levels, to tackle this grand challenge. \\u00b5Former achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks, including predicting high-order mutants, modeling epistatic effects, handling insertion/deletion mutations, and generalizing to out-of-distribution scenarios. On the basis of prediction power, integrating \\u00b5Former with a reinforcement learning framework enables efficient exploration of the vast mutant space. We showcase that this integrated approach can design protein variants with up to 5-point mutations and potentially significant enhancement in activity for engineering tasks. The results highlight \\u00b5Former as a powerful and versatile tool for protein design, accelerating the development of innovative proteins tailored for specific applications.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Blood cell recognition plays a huge role in medicine. Many researchers have recently promoted the use of deep learning models to improve the accuracy of blood cell recognition. However, many remain challenges, such as the unavailability of large training data sets and the similarity between normal and malignant cells. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposed a novel method to extract the feature of blood cell images in the preprocessing step of a deep learning-based blood cell recognition system. First, the color blood cell image as a third-order tensor is expressed, and then compute its core tensor using high-order singular value decomposition (HOSVD). Second, a new core tensor is created by fixing the second frontal slice, and the remaining frontal slices are set to all-zero matrices. Finally, the feature of the blood cell was obtained by reconstructing the image with the new core tensor by inverting HOSVD. Experiments performed on two most famous public medical datasets named BCCD and Raabin-WBC using three state-of-art deep learning models, AlexNet, GoogLeNet, and ResNet show that by using the proposed feature image, a very high accuracy recognition rate is obtained, higher the using original images even use only small amount data for training.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Phasor measurement units (PMUs) play a crucial role in ensuring the reliable operation of modern power grid monitoring systems, such as wide-area measurement systems (WAMS). These systems heavily rely on accurate time synchronization, typically achieved through the Global Positioning System (GPS). However, the open nature of civilian GPS signals exposes PMUs to potential time synchronization attacks (TSA), where malicious actors manipulate PMU time stamps by transmitting deceptive GPS signals in close proximity to the PMUs. In this paper, we propose a framework for TSA detection using machine learning (ML) models at the control center of a WAMS. The feature set used includes power and correlation distortion measurements, which can be extracted in real-time using any generic GPS receiver. We propose a spoof detector based on representation learning, which offers advantages over supervised ML methods by not requiring exhaustive coverage of all possible attack scenarios during training. Instead, it can be trained using only authentic GPS features. Experimental results highlight that our proposed method performs comparably or even surpasses the performance of the compared ML algorithms. This improvement is particularly evident when considering the TEXBAT subtle attack scenario DS-7, where the ML methods struggle to detect the presence of spoofers. In contrast, our proposed method achieves a detection probability of 98% at a false alarm probability of 2.5%.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"In buildings, radon gas mainly enters through cracks in the floors and gaps around pipes and cables in contact with the soil, thereby increasing indoor radon levels. Like other building components or systems, the radon control measures have embodied and operational environmental impacts that have been neglected to a certain extent. While many actions have been taken recently to achieve carbon-neutral yet energy-efficient buildings, even radon control measures should be investigated not only for protecting human health since radon gas is the major source of ionising radiation for humans but also for the environment. This paper aims to undertake a comparative analysis of the embodied and operational impacts of variant radon-protective measures installed at the floor foundation level (both active and passive solutions) for new and existing buildings. In particular, this analysis includes four different measures based on radon venting from i) floor air gap created from plastic components, ii) flexible perforated pipes embedded in the gravel layer under the floor, iii) radon sump placed in the sub-floor layer, and iv) perforated tubes drilled horizontally into the subsoil under the house. In all cases, radon will be removed through a vertical exhaust pipe terminated above the roof or by a roof fan. The impacts are calculated for the life cycle assessment (LCA) stages A1-A3 (production phase) and B6 (operational energy) to determine whether future research should be focused on the reduction of environmental impacts on the production stages or the operational ones.\",\n",

However, existing methods often ignore the limitations of receptive field size during feature extraction and the loss of important information during network sampling, resulting in incomplete or structurally flawed dehazing outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-level perception fusion dehazing network (MPFDN) that effectively integrates feature information across different scales, expands the perceptual field of the network, and fully extracts the spatial background information of the image. Moreover, we employ an error feedback mechanism and a feature compensator to address the loss of features during the image dehazing process. Finally, we subtract the original hazy image from the generated residual image to obtain a high-quality dehazed image. Based on extensive experimentation, our proposed method has demonstrated outstanding performance not only on synthesizing dehazing datasets, but also on non-homogeneous haze datasets.\",\n",

The rate of aircraft delays and the consequent economic loss can be managed by civil aviation agencies with the help of analysis and forecasting of flight delay propagation in advance. Data on flight chains is notoriously difficult to compile due to the small number of possible data combinations. Traditional machine learning algorithms with a small sample size have been widely used in recent years for the investigation of the flight delay propagation problem. Preprocessing, feature selection, and model performance evaluation are all used in the suggested method. Data cleaning, data fusion, and normalization are used in the suggested method for preprocessing. IG is used for selecting features to analyze. The proposed method employs supplementary GRU for assessing the model's performance. When compared to two other methods, such as CNN and GRU, the proposed strategy performs exceptionally well.\",\n",

However, there are atypical samples that are rare and hard to learn, or even hurt DNNs' generalization performance on test data. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to reweight the training samples based on self-supervised techniques to mitigate the negative effects of the atypical samples. \\nSpecifically, a memory bank is built to record the popular samples as prototypes and calculate the memorization weight for each sample, evaluating the \\\"typicalness\\\" of a sample. All the training samples are reweigthed based on the proposed memorization weights to reduce the negative effects of atypical samples. Experimental results show the proposed method is flexible to boost state-of-the-art adversarial training methods, improving both robustness and standard accuracy of DNNs.\",\n",

We analyzed the foggy image pixel distributions in the RGB color space to understand how humans perceive the fog degree and to extract fog degree features from the fog attention map generated by a vision transformer. The patterns mapping the fog feature vectors to the fog degrees were approximated using a generalized regression neural network learned from 10,000 synthetic and natural fog images. The proposed method was evaluated for actual indoor smog images. The proposed method estimated the fog degrees sufficiently accurately, regardless of image scenes, to be used for practical systems.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Abstract In addition to the total amount of exposure to stressors in daily life, the types of stressors experienced (e.g., work stress, arguments), and the relative spread of the stressor types experienced (stressor diversity) is key to emotional and physical well-being across adulthood and aging. While daily stress processes and their links to health and well-being have been studied extensively, historical changes in daily stress processes have been largely unexplored. To examine secular trends in the types of daily stressors experienced across adulthood, we use data from two independent cohorts of the National Study of Daily Experiences surveyed 18 years apart (1995/1996 cohort: n = 1,499 adults aged 20 to 74 years; 2013/2014 cohort: n = 782 adults aged 25 to 75, stratified by age and gender to match the 1995-96 cohort). General linear models are used to test cohort differences in total stressor exposure, exposure to specific types of stressors, and stressor diversity, all controlling for age, income relative to cohort, education relative to cohort, gender, and chronic conditions. While the 2013/2014 cohort experience higher exposure to stressors in daily life than the 1995/1996 cohort, the cohorts experience the same stressor diversity, which decreases with older age. The specific stressor types experienced differ by cohort: adults in 2013/2014 report more arguments, avoided arguments, and work stressors, but less discrimination stressors and \\u201cother\\u201d stressors than in 1995/1996. These results highlight the sociohistorical embedding of daily stressor experiences. Sociodemographic differences and implications for future research and clinical practice are discussed.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The mining of antidiabetic dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory peptides (DPP-IV-IPs) is currently a costly and laborious process. Due to the absence of rational peptide design rules, it relies on cumbersome screening of unknown enzyme hydrolysates. Here, we present an enhanced deep learning model called bidirectional encoder representation (BERT)\\u2013DPPIV, specifically designed to classify DPP-IV-IPs and explore their design rules to discover potent candidates. The end-to-end model utilizes a fine-tuned BERT architecture to extract structural/functional information from input peptides and accurately identify DPP-IV-Ips from input peptides. Experimental results in the benchmark data set showed BERT\\u2013DPPIV yielded state-of-the-art accuracy and MCC of 0.894 and 0.790, surpassing the 0.797 and 0.594 obtained by the sequence-feature model. Furthermore, we leveraged the attention mechanism to uncover that our model could recognize the restriction enzyme cutting site and specific residues that contribute to the inhibition of DPP-IV. Moreover, guided by BERT\\u2013DPPIV, proposed design rules for DPP-IV inhibitory tripeptides and pentapeptides were validated, and they can be used to screen potent DPP-IV-IPs.\",\n",

While IoT emphasizes more on scalable and efficient communications, AI focuses more on reproducing human capabilities such as recognition and forecasting. An efficient AIoT platform may not be obtained directly from integrating existing IoT and AI serving platforms by considering the AIoT service reproduction and evolution. In this work, we propose an AIoT platform that empowers developers to build sophisticated and scalable applications. Our platform is derived based on exchange-based RabbitMQ broker and Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) to facilitate the communications among heterogeneous data sources and AI models. By incorporating an AMQP broker, it supports diverse data exchanges, AI models chaining, and flexible message routing and processing. AI models can be deployed efficiently through containerization with flexible and shared data paths to facilitate computations. Hence, developers can focus on service and application requirements. We also present a case study in smart healthcare to validate our design.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The high-luminosity phase of operation of the CERN Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) will pose new challenges to the detectors and their readout electronics. In particular, the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) barrel electromagnetic calorimeter will require a full redesign of the electronic readout chain in order to cope with the increase in luminosity and trigger rate. In this framework, a new application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) integrating A/D conversion, lossless data compression, and high-speed transmission has been developed and tested. The ASIC, named Lisboa-Torino Ecal Data Transmission Unit (LiTE-DTU), is designed in a commercial CMOS 65-nm process and embeds two 12-bit, 160-MS/s analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), a data selection and compression logic, and a 1.28-Gb/s output serial link. The high-speed 1.28-GHz clock is generated internally from the 160-MHz input by a clock multiplication phase-locked loop (PLL). The circuit has been designed implementing radiation-tolerant techniques in order to work in the harsh environment of the HL-LHC upgrade. The LiTE-DTU is currently in the preproduction phase. A sample of 600 chips has been tested and incorporated into front-end (FE) boards for systems performance testing.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Deep learning has expedited important breakthroughs in research and commercial applications for next-generation technologies across many domains including Automatic Target Recognition (ATR). The success of these models in a specific application is often attributed to optimized hyperparameters: user-configured values controlling the model\\u2019s ability to learn from data. Tuning hyperparameters however remains a difficult and computationally expensive task contributing to deficient ATR model performance compared to set requirements. We present the efficacy of applying our developed hyperparameter optimization method to boost the effectiveness and performance of any given optimization method. Specifically, we use a generalized additive model surrogate homotopy hyperparameter optimization strategy to approximate regions of interest and trace minimal points over regions of the hyperparameter space instead of ineffectively evaluating the entire hyperparameter surface. We integrate our approach into SHADHO (Scalable Hardware-Aware Distributed Hyperparameter Optimization) a hyperparameter optimization framework that computes the relative complexity of each search space and then monitors the performance of the learning task over the trials. We demonstrate how our approach effectively finds optimal hyperparameters for object detection by conducting a model search to optimize multiple object detection algorithms on a subset of the DSIAC ATR Algorithm Development Image Database and finding models that achieve comparable or lower validation loss in fewer iterations than standard techniques and manual tuning practices.\",\n",

      "      \"title\": \"A Single-Loop Deep Actor-Critic Algorithm for Constrained Reinforcement Learning with Provable Convergence\",\n",
      "      \"abstract\": \"Abstract -- Deep Actor-Critic algorithms, which combine Actor-Critic with deep neural network (DNN), have been among the most prevalent reinforcement learning algorithms for decision-making problems in simulated environments. However, the existing deep Actor-Critic algorithms are still not mature to solve realistic problems with non-convex stochastic constraints and high cost to interact with the environment. In this paper, we propose a single-loop deep Actor-Critic (SLDAC) algorithmic framework for general constrained reinforcement learning (CRL) problems. In the actor step, the constrained stochastic successive convex approximation (CSSCA) method is applied to handle the non-convex stochastic objective and constraints. In the critic step, the critic DNNs are only updated once or a few finite times for each iteration, which simplifies the algorithm to a single-loop framework (the existing works require a sufficient number of updates for the critic step to ensure a good enough convergence of the inner loop for each iteration). Moreover, the variance of the policy gradient estimation is reduced by reusing observations from the old policy. The single-loop design and the observation reuse effectively reduce the agent-environment interaction cost and computational complexity. In spite of the biased policy gradient estimation incurred by the single-loop design and observation reuse, we prove that the SLDAC with a feasible initial point can converge to a Karush-Kuhn-Tuker (KKT) point of the original problem almost surely. Simulations show that the SLDAC algorithm can achieve superior performance with much lower interaction cost.\",\n",

The gamesand sports are e great unifying force and have tremendous effect on the national and international integration. Through the origin of sports is lost in antiquity, it is quite certain that physical activity has been a part of the life of even primitive men. For himit might have been a basic necessity of life,more than fun and diversion, for his survival depended on it. Hunting, fishing, hurling missiles were activities on whichhis survival depended.Gradually along with the process of evolution, such activities become more of play and become part of the culture of the tribes. People use sports and games as a mode of transmitting the cultural heritage of their tribes. Games sports and physical activities persisted despite the rise and fall of ancient civilizations and become strongly embedded in the history of civilizations as a culture heritage, which was passed on from one generation to another. Today, games and sports have emerged as universal cultural phenomena. Sports and games propagate the feelings of nationalism and help in creating a new generation of individuals with the feelings that the difference basedon caste, community and religion have no meaning and faith in love and peace, in purity, in the feeling of goodwill and brotherhood serves to a greater extent towards humanity. Sports and games provide a common platform wheresportsperson for different regions, professing different religions and faiths, speaking different languages, havingdifferent customs and traditions interact with each other in harmonious and emerge as a homogenous group. Such type of thinking insight and mental approach can play positive role in nation integration. Sports and games help in creating such understanding and can play decisive and pivotal role in bringing about national integration.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Biosurfactants are bio-based amphiphilic molecules with extensive applications in various industries. These eco-friendly alternatives possess numerous advantages over chemical surfactants. However, high production costs hinder market competitiveness of biosurfactants. Production costs of synthetic surfactants range between $1-3/kg, while biosurfactants cost between $20-25/kg. Principal challenges hindering commercialization of biosurfactants are high costs of media constituents and downstream processing, accounting for 30% and 60-80% of production costs, respectively. Thus, cost-effective biosurfactant production would depend on the utilization of environment-friendly low-cost substrates and efficient product recovery. To this end, statistical tools such as Factorial Designs (FD) and Response Surface Methodology (RSM), are employed to optimize the production processes. FD as effective screening models comprise Plackett-Burman Design (PBD) and Taguchi design; and involves quantification of various significant factor effects including the main effect and level of dependency of one factor on the level of one or more factors. RSM predicts appropriate proportions of media constituents and optimal culture conditions; and is reportedly effective in reducing production cost and consequently, market price. Central Composite Design (CCD) and Box-Behnken Design (BBD) are common RSM for optimizing biosurfactants production. CCD assesses the relationship between one factor or more and a set of experimental variables. BBD is considered more proficient than CCD as it requires fewer experimental runs. Most recently, Artificial Neural Network which uses artificial intelligence-based tools to predict biosurfactant production using dependent variables of the process is gaining attention.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"This research study delves into the realm of enhancing the Reynolds stress model through the remarkable capabilities of machine learning. Focusing on two key aspects, we investigate the modeling of fluctuating pressure-rate-of-strain tensor and uncertainty quantification in turbulent fluid flows. In the first part of our investigation, a neural network is employed to predict the pressure-strain correlation term for the frictional Reynolds number, even in cases where it was not trained. Through the use of high-fidelity datasets, we surpass the limitations of traditional numerical methods, achieving more accurate results with reduced computational costs. Going beyond conventional analysis, we explore the isotropic and anisotropic components of the pressure-strain correlation term. Intriguingly, our findings unveil the significant influence of production and redistribution terms on the anisotropic component by 50% and viscous dissipation impacts the isotropic part by 65% in wall-bounded turbulent flows. The second part introduces a novel approach for uncertainty quantification in the Reynolds stress model. Leveraging a binary classification model, we identify error-prone points within the simulation domain with an impressive accuracy of up to 95%. This critical step paves the way for a deeper understanding of uncertainties in turbulent flows for more reliable predictions. By harnessing the power of machine learning, our study provides two compelling ways to enhance the Reynolds stress model, contributing to a more efficient and dependable prediction of turbulent fluid dynamics.\",\n",

MEPE uses the predictive uncertainty of a Gaussian process (GP) to balance exploration and exploitation when selecting the next training sample. However, the predictive uncertainty of a GP is unlikely to be accurate or precise immediately after training. We hypothesize that calibrating the uncertainty quantification within MEPE will improve active learning performance. We develop and test two methods to improve uncertainty estimates: post-hoc calibration of predictive uncertainty using the CRUDE algorithm, and replacing the GP with a student-t process. We investigate the impact of these methods on MEPE for single sample and batch sample active learning. Our findings suggest that post-hoc calibration does not improve the performance of active learning using the MEPE method. However, we do find that the student-t process can outperform active learning strategies and random sampling using a GP if the training set is sufficiently large.\",\n",

Skin cancer detection is difficult because of differences in lesion size, shape, and lighting conditions. To address this, an innovative approach called \\u201cODL-SCDC\\u201d, combining deep learning with IoT technology, is developed. The proposed model uses advanced techniques like hyperparameter selection and feature extraction to improve skin cancer classification. The results show that ODL-SCDC outperforms other methods in accurately identifying skin lesions, which could have a significant impact on early cancer detection in the medical field. Abstract Internet of Things (IoT)-assisted skin cancer recognition integrates several connected devices and sensors for supporting the primary analysis and monitoring of skin conditions. A preliminary analysis of skin cancer images is extremely difficult because of factors such as distinct sizes and shapes of lesions, differences in color illumination, and light reflections on the skin surface. In recent times, IoT-based skin cancer recognition utilizing deep learning (DL) has been used for enhancing the early analysis and monitoring of skin cancer. This article presents an optimal deep learning-based skin cancer detection and classification (ODL-SCDC) methodology in the IoT environment. The goal of the ODL-SCDC technique is to exploit metaheuristic-based hyperparameter selection approaches with a DL model for skin cancer classification. The ODL-SCDC methodology involves an arithmetic optimization algorithm (AOA) with the EfficientNet model for feature extraction. For skin cancer detection, a stacked denoising autoencoder (SDAE) classification model has been used. Lastly, the dragonfly algorithm (DFA) is utilized for the optimal hyperparameter selection of the SDAE algorithm. The simulation validation of the ODL-SCDC methodology has been tested on a benchmark ISIC skin lesion database. The extensive outcomes reported a better solution of the ODL-SCDC methodology compared with other models, with a maximum sensitivity of 97.74%, specificity of 99.71%, and accuracy of 99.55%. The proposed model can assist medical professionals, specifically dermatologists and potentially other healthcare practitioners, in the skin cancer diagnosis process.\",\n",

Our classification method is based on local conformation and environmental fingerprints of individual monomers. In particular, we employ self-supervised auto-encoders to compress the fingerprint information and a Gaussian mixture model to distinguish ordered states from disordered ones. The resulting identification of crystalline monomers agrees to a large extent with human-defined classifiers such as the stem-length-based classification scheme as developed in our previous work [C. Luo and J.-U. Sommer, Macromolecules 44 (2011), 1523], but does not require any foreknowledge about the structure of semi-crystalline polymers. Because of its local sensitivity, the method allows the resolution of detailed time patterns of crystalline order before an apparent signature of the transition is visible in thermodynamic properties such as for the specific volume. At a pre-transition point, we observe the highest crystallization efficiency using the fraction of monomers being conserved in the crystalline phase as compared to the number of monomers joining that phase.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"There has been a surge of interest in applying deep learning in particle and nuclear physics to replace labor-intensive offline data analysis with automated online machine learning tasks. This paper details a novel AI-enabled triggering solution for physics experiments in Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and future Electron-Ion Collider. The triggering system consists of a comprehensive end-to-end pipeline based on Graph Neural Networks that classifies trigger events versus background events, makes online decisions to retain signal data, and enables efficient data acquisition. The triggering system first starts with the coordinates of pixel hits lit up by passing particles in the detector, applies three stages of event processing (hits clustering, track reconstruction, and trigger detection), and labels all processed events with the binary tag of trigger versus background events. By switching among different objective functions, we train the Graph Neural Networks in the pipeline to solve multiple tasks: the edge-level track reconstruction problem, the edge-level track adjacency matrix prediction, and the graph-level trigger detection problem. We propose a novel method to treat the events as track-graphs instead of hit-graphs. This method focuses on intertrack relations and is driven by underlying physics processing. As a result, it attains a solid performance (around 72% accuracy) for trigger detection and outperforms the baseline method using hit-graphs by 2% higher accuracy.\",\n",

Common upper-limb assessments, such as the Box and Blocks Test and Nine Hole Peg Test, primarily evaluate gross motor function in terms of speed. These assessments neglect an individual's ability to finely regulate grip force, which is critical in activities of daily living, such as manipulating fragile objects. Here we present the Electronic Grip Gauge (EGG), an instrumented fragile object that assesses both gross and fine motor function. Embedded with a load cell, accelerometer, and Hall-effect sensor, the EGG measures grip force, acceleration, and relative position (via magnetic fields) in real time. The EGG can emit an audible \\u201cbreak\\u201d sound when the applied grip force exceeds a threshold. The number of breaks, transfer duration, and applied forces are automatically logged in real-time. Using the EGG, we evaluated sensorimotor function in implicit grasping and gentle grasping for the non-paretic and paretic hands of 3 hemiparetic stroke patients. For all participants, the paretic hand took longer to transfer the EGG during implicit grasping. For 2 of 3 participants, grip forces were significantly greater for the paretic hand during gentle grasping. Differences in implicit grasping forces were unique to each participant. This work constitutes an important step towards more widespread and quantitative measures of sensorimotor function, which may ultimately lead to improved personalized rehabilitation and better patient outcomes.\",\n",

While wearable mobile eye trackers have become more readily available, there are no existing analysis methods for accurately and efficiently mapping dynamic gaze data on dynamic areas of interest (AOIs), which limits their utility in human factors research. The purpose of this paper was to outline a proposed framework for automating the analysis of dynamic areas of interest by integrating computer vision and machine learning (CVML). The framework is then tested using a use-case of a Central Venous Catheterization trainer with six dynamic AOIs. While the results of the validity trial indicate there is room for improvement in the CVML method proposed, the framework provides direction and guidance for human factors researchers using dynamic AOIs.\",\n",

Our choice of using the Temporal Convolution Network (TCN) stems from its superior performance compared to traditional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) like LSTMs, across a diverse array of tasks and datasets.

In this research, we employ TCNs as the chosen approach to evaluate their capability in forecasting directional shifts beyond the sample data for individual components within the CSI 300. The dataset spans from January 2009 to December 2020, targeting intraday trading. Furthermore, inspired by Fischer and Krauss (2018), we expand the input features to encompass not only returns based on closing prices but also those based on opening prices and intraday returns.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Through the attention mechanism, Transformer-based large-scale deep neural networks (LSDNNs) have demonstrated remarkable achievements in artificial intelligence applications such as natural language processing and computer vision. The matrix-matrix multiplication operation (MMMO) in Transformer makes data movement dominate the inference overhead over computation. A solution for efficient data movement during Transformer inference is to embed arithmetic logic units (ALUs) into the memory array, hence an accelerator-in-memory architecture (AIMA). Existing work along this direction has not considered the heterogeneity of parallelism and resource requirements among Transformer layers. This increases the inference latency and lowers the resource utilization, which is critical for the embedded systems domain. To this end, we propose HAIMA, a hybrid AIMA and the parallel dataflow for Transformer, which exploit the cooperation between SRAM and DRAM to accelerate different MMMOs. Compared to the state-of-the-art Newton and TransPIM, our proposed hardware-software co-design achieves 1.4x-1.5x speedup, and solves the problem of resource under-utilization when DRAM-based AIMA performs the light-weight MMMOs.\",\n",

This paper proposes that in the point-cloud preprocessing stage, the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Algorithm with Noise (DBSCAN) is added to cluster the three-dimensional\\n point cloud, then the clustering results are extracted through the PointNet deep learning network to extract the characteristics of the local area, thus outputting the classification results of the point cloud. This method can not only reflect the feature distribution of point cloud in three-dimensional\\n space, but also can be divided into several classes according to the different shape features of point cloud.

      "      \"abstract\": \"Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a chronic disease that damages the spinal cord, leading to the loss of neuronal function, especially sensorimotor functions. Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) controlled rehabilitation systems offer a promising therapeutic treatment for individuals with SCI. Their treatment often involves a lengthy and demanding rehabilitation process. For this reason, we introduced an innovative approach that utilizes an electroencephalography (EEG)-based BCI rehabilitation system to assist SCI patients. Our study involved the analysis of low-frequency EEG signals from nine individuals with SCIs while attempting arm and hand movements. EEG analysis generally consists of preprocessing, feature extraction, and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for classification. However, relying solely on traditional methods for each step may prove inadequate for real-time applications. Traditional approaches can sometimes be limited by the complexity and high dimensionality of the signals. To address these challenges, we employed Manifold Learning, which allows for a more effective representation of the temporal and spatial features of brain activity in a lower-dimensional space of EEG signals. Our study obtained certain results by trying Spectral Embedding and Local Linear Embedding methods as Manifold Learning algorithms. The classification was implemented using k-NN, Naive Bayes, and SVM methods. According to the average results, the k-NN algorithm gives the best accuracies for Local Linear Embedding methods obtained at 0.995, and the Spectral Embedding methods obtained at 0.996. While comparing the Manifold Learning methods, we achieved the highest success in Spectral Embedding.\",\n",

It involves analysing the presence of damage, locating the fault, determining the severity of the problem, and calculating the amount of time that the machine can still be used effectively by making use of signal processing methods. The journey started to repair when the machine fails and progressed to the modern era, which involves the use of advanced sensors to capture data and conduct on-line signal processing methods to extract relevant features. By seamlessly integrating advanced smart sensing, data collection, and intelligent algorithms, modern technologies have transformed the landscape of condition-based maintenance for rotary machinery, bridging the gap between fundamental understanding and practical engineering applications. In this review paper, first, the roadmap of the condition-based maintenance (CBM) journey for rotary machinery is briefly introduced. Then, CBM task techniques are reviewed in the context of manual identification of defects, applying artificial intelligence (AI) model to identify the defect in the rotary machinery, and AI to carry out defect prognosis and determine the remaining useful life. Finally, the challenges, and issues of signal processing methods to detect faults in rotary machinery, and remedies to overcome such challenges are deeply discussed and future research directions are identified to ensure safe operation for rotary machinery.\",\n",

However, since the embedding of a node is updated according to the information aggregated from the immediate neighborhood, a GNN tends to capture the community memberships of the nodes better than the other side of the coin: the role memberships, which quantify how much nodes carry out specific functions from a structural point of view. In this paper, we present RC-GNNs, a category of GNNs designed to learn embeddings from the community and the role memberships as well as the features of the nodes. RC-GNNs learn from different versions of the same graph, in which the nodes are connected according to either the community or the role memberships. Results show that, compared with models such as k-hop GNNs, k-GNNs, and MixHop, RC-GNNs are up to 4% more accurate in classifying the nodes of CiteSeer, Cora, and PubMed and up to 3% in classifying the graphs of MUTAG, PROTEINS, and Synthie.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Traffic prediction plays an important role in network resource management. Existing deep learning based traffic prediction methods have huge data requirements and limited accuracy, it is difficult to be used in emerging cellular networks, e.g., 6G. Hence, this article proposes a multi-feature prediction network (MFPNet) based on signaling information to overcome the existing problems. Firstly, after exploiting the correlation between traffic and signaling data (i.e., Evolved Radio Access Bearer, Radio Resource Control, etc.). MFPNet is presented for a single base station (BS). Moreover, multi-input convolutional neural network is introduced into MFPNet for feature extraction of signaling information, and a short-term memory network is used for learning temporal correlations. Secondly, MFPNet is extended for multiple BSs using both transfer learning and federated learning to achieve accurate traffic prediction using only data from a few base stations. The former uses the fine-tune method for knowledge transfer between BSs, and the latter uses the double-headed federated prediction model to increase the accuracy of traffic prediction. Finally, the proposed method is validated with real-world traffic data obtained from Shenzhen. The experimental results show the superiority of the proposed models over other benchmark schemes in terms of accuracy and data requirements.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations offer a computationally efficient way of solving fluid flow problems in engineering applications. However, the use of closure models to represent turbulence effects can compromise their accuracy. In order to address this issue, recent research has explored data-driven techniques like data assimilation and machine learning. We present an efficient variational data assimilation (DA) approach to enhance steady-state RANS simulations based on eddy viscosity closure models. Our method introduces a corrective forcing term based on a potential field that is divergence-free and enhances simulation accuracy. The DA implementation relies on the discrete adjoint method and approximations for efficient gradient evaluation. The implementation is built on a two-dimensional coupled RANS solver in \\\\emph{OpenFOAM}, which is extended to allow the computation of the adjoint velocity and pressure as well as the adjoint gradient. A gradient-based optimizer is employed to minimize the difference between the simulation results and the reference data. To assess this approach, it is compared with alternative data assimilation methods for canonical stationary two-dimensional turbulent flow problems. For the DA, sparsely distributed data from averaged high-fidelity simulation results are used. The findings indicate that the proposed method achieves the optimization goal more efficiently compared to applying data assimilation for obtaining the eddy viscosity, or a field modifying the eddy viscosity, directly. It is sturdy with respect to varying the regularization parameters and the number of reference data points, and runs efficiently by leveraging coarse meshes.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Background Music therapy is a promising complementary intervention for addressing various mental health conditions. Despite evidence of the beneficial effects of music, the acoustic features that make music effective in therapeutic contexts remain elusive. Aims This study aimed to identify and validate distinctive acoustic features of healing music. Methods We constructed a healing music dataset (HMD) based on nominations from related professionals and extracted 370 acoustic features. Healing-distinctive acoustic features were identified as those that were (1) independent from genre within the HMD, (2) significantly different from music pieces in a classical music dataset (CMD) and (3) similar to pieces in a five-element music dataset (FEMD). We validated the identified features by comparing jazz pieces in the HMD with a jazz music dataset (JMD). We also examined the emotional properties of the features in a Chinese affective music system (CAMS). Results The HMD comprised 165 pieces. Among all the acoustic features, 74.59% shared commonalities across genres, and 26.22% significantly differed between the HMD classical pieces and the CMD. The equivalence test showed that the HMD and FEMD did not differ significantly in 9.46% of the features. The potential healing-distinctive acoustic features were identified as the standard deviation of the roughness, mean and period entropy of the third coefficient of the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients. In a three-dimensional space defined by these features, HMD\\u2019s jazz pieces could be distinguished from those of the JMD. These three features could significantly predict both subjective valence and arousal ratings in the CAMS. Conclusions The distinctive acoustic features of healing music that have been identified and validated in this study have implications for the development of artificial intelligence models for identifying therapeutic music, particularly in contexts where access to professional expertise may be limited. This study contributes to the growing body of research exploring the potential of digital technologies for healthcare interventions.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Social media images, curated or casual, have become a crucial component of communicating situational information and emotions during health crises. Despite its prevalence and significance in informational dissemination and emotional connection, there lacks a comprehensive understanding of visual crisis communication in the aftermath of a pandemic which is characterized by uncertain local situations and emotional fatigue. To fill this gap, this work collected 345,423 crisis-related posts and 65,376 original images during the Xi'an COVID-19 local outbreak in China, and adopted a mixed-methods approach to understanding themes, goals, and strategies of crisis imagery. Image clustering captured the diversity of visual themes during the outbreak, such as text images embedding authoritative guidelines and ``visual diaries'' recording and sharing the quarantine life. Through text classification of the post that visuals were situated in, we found that different visual themes highly correlated with the informational and emotional goals of the post text, such as adopting text images to convey the latest policies and sharing food images to express anxiety. We further unpacked nuanced strategies of crisis image use through inductive coding, such as signifying authority and triggering empathy. We discuss the opportunities and challenges of crisis imagery and provide design implications to facilitate effective visual crisis communication.\",\n",

The ELAN in Head is replaced with the RepLKNet architecture, which uses a small number of large convolutional kernels to reduce memory consumption and improve the ability to capture shape bias thus enhancing image features; SPPF is introduced to optimise the multi-branch operation of the SPCSPC module to save computational resources and improve operational efficiency by exploiting its high processing speed; the SimAM attention mechanism is embedded in MP to give higher weights to highly characterized neurons are given higher weights to improve the network\\u2019s ability to capture key features; a new metric WiseIoU3 is introduced to replace IoU at the regression loss function of the detection head, and its gradient gain allocation strategy is applied to improve the overall detection performance of the model. The improved algorithm achieves 80.7% mAP on the EDS dataset, a 2.6% improvement over YOLOv7, with a significant reduction in the number of parameters and computation and a large improvement in FPS.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Federated learning (FL) is an emerging paradigm for decentralized training of machine learning models on distributed clients, without revealing the data to the central server. The learning scheme may be horizontal, vertical or hybrid (both vertical and horizontal). Most existing research work with deep neural network (DNN) modelling is focused on horizontal data distributions, while vertical and hybrid schemes are much less studied. In this paper, we propose a generalized algorithm FedEmb, for modelling vertical and hybrid DNN-based learning. The idea of our algorithm is characterised by higher inference accuracy, stronger privacy-preserving properties, and lower client-server communication bandwidth demands as compared with existing work. The experimental results show that FedEmb is an effective method to tackle both split feature&subject space decentralized problems, shows 0.3% to 4.2% inference accuracy improvement with limited privacy revealing for datasets stored in local clients, and reduces 88.9 % time complexity over vertical baseline method.\",\n",

For several years, credit agencies have used statistical methods like regression and discriminant analysis to assess the probability of bankruptcy. However, as Deep Learning and Neural Networks are gaining more momentum to solve more challenging problems, we are turning our attention towards them to address our immediate problems. In this paper, we attempt to explore and apply the working of various neural network methodologies, including the basic architecture, application of regularization techniques, such as L1, L2, Dropout and Early Stopping, to observe the difference in performance for predicting bankruptcy. Other machine learning algorithms such as SVM, Random Forest and XGBoost have also been implemented to compare their performance with neural networks. The results achieved in terms of accuracy were as follows; 82%, 49%, 89%, 90% and 94% for ordinary neural network model, L1, L2, Dropout and Early Stopping methods respectively. Other models, SVM, RF and XGBoost showed an accuracy of 87%, 86% and 85% respectively.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The brain extracellular space (ECS), an irregular, extremely tortuous nanoscale space located between cells or between cells and blood vessels, is crucial for nerve cell survival. It plays a pivotal role in high-level brain functions such as memory, emotion, and sensation. However, the specific form of molecular transport within the ECS remain elusive. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel approach to quantitatively analyze the molecular transport within the ECS by solving an inverse problem derived from the advection-diffusion equation (ADE) using a physics-informed neural network (PINN). PINN provides a streamlined solution to the ADE without the need for intricate mathematical formulations or grid settings. Additionally, the optimization of PINN facilitates the automatic computation of the diffusion coefficient governing long-term molecule transport and the velocity of molecules driven by advection. Consequently, the proposed method allows for the quantitative analysis and identification of the specific pattern of molecular transport within the ECS through the calculation of the P\\u00e9clet number. Experimental validation on two datasets of magnetic resonance images (MRIs) captured at different time points showcases the effectiveness of the proposed method. Notably, our simulations reveal identical molecular transport patterns between datasets representing rats with tracer injected into the same brain region. These findings highlight the potential of PINN as a promising tool for comprehensively exploring molecular transport within the ECS.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"\\u2014The NAND flash memory channel is corrupted by different types of noises, such as the data retention noise and the wear-out noise, which lead to unknown channel offset and make the flash memory channel non-stationary. In the literature, machine learning-based methods have been proposed for data detection for flash memory channels. However, these methods require a large number of training samples and labels to achieve a satisfactory performance, which is costly. Furthermore, with a large unknown channel offset, it may be impossible to obtain enough correct labels. In this paper, we reformulate the data detection for the flash memory channel as a transfer learning (TL) problem. We then propose a model-based deep TL (DTL) algorithm for flash memory channel detection. It can effectively reduce the training data size from 10 6 samples to less than 10 4 samples. Moreover, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA)-based DTL algorithm using moment alignment, which can detect data without any labels. Hence, it is suitable for scenarios where the decoding of error-correcting code fails and no labels can be obtained. Finally, a UDA-based threshold detector is proposed to eliminate the need for a neural network. Both the channel raw error rate analysis and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DTL-based detection schemes can achieve near-optimal bit error rate (BER) performance with much less training data and/or without using any labels.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"This paper adapts the deep learning pipeline algorithm based on the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Network to automatically classify the forest Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) point cloud. To achieve this, the Machine Learning (ML) algorithm parameters such as input layer elements, number of hidden layers, activation functions, and alpha value are optimized to achieve the best possible performance. Regarding the important role of the geometric features in the input layer, most of the suggested features in the literature are analyzed to employ the more effective ones in the algorithm input layer. As a result, seven geometric features, in addition to the 3D coordinates of the point cloud, are chosen to represent the first algorithm layer. The proposed algorithm classifies the forest LiDAR point cloud into two classes: vegetation and terrain. The proposed approach was tested using two points of clouds, one of a flat area and the other of a mountain area. The results of using the suggested approach provide an accuracy score greater than 98%. The obtained result confirms the high efficiency of the proposed classification algorithm regarding the envisaged approaches in the literature. Finally, the next step is to generalize this approach to classify more complicated scenes as urban areas.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Deep learning has become a powerful tool for solving inverse problems in electromagnetic medical imaging. However, contemporary deep-learning-based approaches are susceptible to inaccuracies stemming from inadequate training datasets, primarily consisting of signals generated from simplified and homogeneous imaging scenarios. This paper introduces a novel methodology to construct an expansive and diverse database encompassing domains featuring randomly shaped structures with electrical properties representative of healthy and abnormal tissues. The core objective of this database is to enable the training of universal deep-learning techniques for permittivity profile reconstruction in complex electromagnetic medical imaging domains. The constructed database contains 25,000 unique objects created by superimposing from 6 to 24 randomly sized ellipses and polygons with varying electrical attributes. Introducing randomness in the database enhances training, allowing the neural network to achieve universality while reducing the risk of overfitting. The representative signals in the database are generated using an array of antennas that irradiate the imaging domain and capture scattered signals. A custom-designed U-net is trained by using those signals to generate the permittivity profile of the defined imaging domain. To assess the database and confirm the universality of the trained network, three distinct testing datasets with diverse objects are imaged using the designed U-net. Quantitative assessments of the generated images show promising results, with structural similarity scores consistently exceeding 0.84, normalized root mean square errors remaining below 14%, and peak signal-to-noise ratios exceeding 33 dB. These results demonstrate the practicality of the constructed database for training deep learning networks that have generalization capabilities in solving inverse problems in medical imaging without the need for additional physical assistant algorithms.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Ontologies are representational artifacts that purport to accurately describe some aspect of reality, including the entities and the relations that hold between them. In computer science, ontologies are software artifacts containing the schematic structure for machine-readable knowledge, typically formed as a graph of subject-predicate-object triples, constrained through Description Logics. These resources and their relations are self-defining, i.e., some resource may be defined by considering all its stated relations. Resources are often attended with natural language annotations, that humans may read and interpret, such as labels and definitions. Many long-standing ontologies have useless lexical definitions that define resources cyclically, e.g., a FOAF: Person is simply defined as \\u201cA person\\u201d. In Aristotelian terms, the definition of a thing should be reducible, by using terms simpler than itself, such that every definition can be unpacked up to the most general thing, which can only be defined by stating examples and use cases. This paper presents an innovative technique that leverages the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) large language model, GPT -4, for automatically generating Aristotelian definition annotations for OWL classes that engenders compliance with the Basic Formal Ontology standard.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"As LLMs become commonplace, machine-generated text has the potential to flood the internet with spam, social media bots, and valueless content. Watermarking is a simple and effective strategy for mitigating such harms by enabling the detection and documentation of LLM-generated text. Yet a crucial question remains: How reliable is watermarking in realistic settings in the wild? There, watermarked text may be modified to suit a user's needs, or entirely rewritten to avoid detection. We study the robustness of watermarked text after it is re-written by humans, paraphrased by a non-watermarked LLM, or mixed into a longer hand-written document. We find that watermarks remain detectable even after human and machine paraphrasing. While these attacks dilute the strength of the watermark, paraphrases are statistically likely to leak n-grams or even longer fragments of the original text, resulting in high-confidence detections when enough tokens are observed. For example, after strong human paraphrasing the watermark is detectable after observing 800 tokens on average, when setting a 1e-5 false positive rate. We also consider a range of new detection schemes that are sensitive to short spans of watermarked text embedded inside a large document, and we compare the robustness of watermarking to other kinds of detectors.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is moderately heritable with significant social and economic impact. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified common variants associated with AUD, however, rare variant investigations have yet to achieve well-powered sample sizes. In this study, we conducted an interval-based exome-wide analysis of the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test Problems subscale (AUDIT-P) using both machine learning (ML) predicted risk and empirical functional weights. This research has been conducted using the UK Biobank Resource (application number 30782.) Filtering the 200k exome release to unrelated individuals of European ancestry resulted in a sample of 147,386 individuals with 51,357 observed and 96,029 unmeasured but predicted AUDIT-P for exome analysis. Sequence Kernel Association Test (SKAT/SKAT-O) was used for rare variant (Minor Allele Frequency (MAF) < 0.01) interval analyses using default and empirical weights. Empirical weights were constructed using annotations found significant by stratified LD Score Regression analysis of predicted AUDIT-P GWAS, providing prior functional weights specific to AUDIT-P. Using only samples with observed AUDIT-P yielded no significantly associated intervals. In contrast, ADH1C and THRA gene intervals were significant (False discovery rate (FDR) <0.05) using default and empirical weights in the predicted AUDIT-P sample, with the most significant association found using predicted AUDIT-P and empirical weights in the ADH1C gene (SKAT-O P Default= 1.06 x 10-9 and P Empirical weight = 6.25 x 10-11). These findings provide evidence for rare variant association of the ADH1C gene with the AUDIT-P and highlight the successful leveraging of ML to increase effective sample size and prior empirical functional weights based on common variant GWAS data to refine and increase the statistical significance in underpowered phenotypes.\",\n",

      "      \"title\": \"A Data-Driven Approach for Building the Profile of Water Storage Capacity of Soils\",\n",
      "      \"abstract\": \"The soil water storage capacity is critical for soil management as it drives crop production, soil carbon sequestration, and soil quality and health. It depends on soil textural class, depth, land-use and soil management practices; therefore, the complexity strongly limits its estimation on a large scale with conventional-process-based approaches. In this paper, a machine learning approach is proposed to build the profile of the soil water storage capacity. A neural network is designed to estimate the soil moisture from the meteorology data input. By taking the soil moisture as a proxy in the modelling, the training captures those impact factors of soil water storage capacity and their nonlinear interaction implicitly without knowing the underlying soil hydrologic processes. An internal vector of the proposed neural network assimilates the soil moisture response to meteorological conditions and is regulated as the profile of the soil water storage capacity. The proposed approach is data-driven. Since the low-cost soil moisture sensors have made soil moisture monitoring simple and the meteorology data are easy to obtain, the proposed approach enables a convenient way of estimating soil water storage capacity in a high sampling resolution and at a large scale. Moreover, an average root mean squared deviation at 0.0307m3/m3 can be achieved in the soil moisture estimation; hence, the trained model can be deployed as an alternative to the expensive sensor networks for continuous soil moisture monitoring. The proposed approach innovatively represents the soil water storage capacity as a vector profile rather than a single value indicator. Compared with the single value indicator, which is common in hydrology, a multidimensional vector can encode more information and thus has a more powerful representation. This can be seen in the anomaly detection demonstrated in the paper, where subtle differences in soil water storage capacity among the sensor sites can be captured even though these sensors are installed on the same grassland. Another merit of vector representation is that advanced numeric methods can be applied to soil analysis. This paper demonstrates such an advantage by clustering sensor sites into groups with the unsupervised K-means clustering on the profile vectors which encapsulate soil characteristics and land properties of each sensor site implicitly.\",\n",

With the maturity and wide application of AI neural network algorithm, irrigation and fertilization for crop growth will develop towards precision and dynamics. In this paper, an automatic control system of garden irrigation based on AI algorithm is proposed. An improved GA (genetic algorithm) is proposed, and FNN (Fuzzy neural network) controller is designed to realize the optimal design of fuzzy control rules. By introducing fuzzy coding method to express the structure of fuzzy neural controller, the task of parameter optimization is greatly reduced and the operation of GA is accelerated. The results show that the proposed FNN has smaller error and higher fitting degree in the prediction of crop evapotranspiration. The irrigation time can be calculated by the predicted irrigation water demand. Simulation results show that the algorithm is reasonable and effective. The optimization algorithm in AI is applied to the traditional FNN to reduce the error and improve the accuracy of the model, and it is successfully implemented in garden irrigation control.\",\n",

This study assessed health care workers\\u2019 (HCWs) self-perceived infection risk and uptake of COVID-19 vaccines. A concurrent embedded, mixed methods design was utilized to collect data among HCWs in seven Tanzanian regions. Quantitative data was collected using a validated, pre-piloted, interviewer administered questionnaire whereas in-depth interviews (IDIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs) gathered qualitative data. Descriptive analyses were performed while chi-square test and logistic regression were used to test for associations across categories. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the qualitative data. A total of 1,368 HCWs responded to the quantitative tool, 26 participated in the IDIs and 74 in FGDs. About half of the HCW (53.6%) reported to have been vaccinated and three quarters (75.5%) self-perceived to be at a high risk of acquiring COVID-19 infection. High perceived infection risk was associated with increased COVID-19 vaccine uptake (OR 1.535). Participants perceived that the nature of their work and the working environment in the health facilities increased their infection risk. Limited availability and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) was reported to elevate the perceived infection risks. Participants in the oldest age group and from low and mid-level health care facilities had higher proportions with a high-risk perception of acquiring COVID-19 infection. Only about half of the HCWs reported to be vaccinated albeit the majority recounted higher perception of risk to contracting COVID-19 due to their working environment, including limited availability and use of PPE. Efforts to address heightened perceived-risks should include improving the working environment, availability of PPE and continue updating HCWs on the benefits of COVID-19 vaccine to limit their infection risks and consequent transmission to their patients and public.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The rapid expansion of nuclear technology across various sectors due to global economic growth has led to a substantial rise in the transportation of radioactive materials. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) estimates that approximately 20 million shipments of radioactive materials occur annually. In this context, ensuring the safety and security of radioactive material transportation is of significant importance. IAEA\\u2019s \\u201cSecurity of Radioactive Materials in Transport\\u201d (Nuclear Security Series No. 9-G) mandates that an effective transport security system should provide immediate detection of any unauthorized removal of the packages. In the present study, an innovative Adam-optimized BP neural network model is developed for detecting unauthorized movements of radioactive material packages. To analyze the performance of the proposed algorithm, numerous experiments were conducted. The results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a 99.17% accuracy rate in detecting unauthorized movements of radioactive materials, with a missed alarm rate of 0.72% and a false alarm rate of 0.1%. This method also enables real-time detection of unauthorized removal of radioactive materials and effectively enhances the security of radioactive materials during transport to reduce the risks of theft, loss, diversion, or sabotage.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"\\n The factors that affect the severity of crashes must be identified for pedestrian and traffic safety in urban roads. Specifically, in the case of urban road crashes, these crashes occur due to the complex interaction of various factors. Therefore, it is necessary to collect high-quality data that can derive these various factors. Accordingly, this study collected crash data, which included detailed crash factor data on the huge urban and mid-level roads. Using this, various crash factors including driver, vehicle, road, environment, and crash characteristics are constructed to develop a crash severity prediction model. Through this, this study identified more detailed factors affecting the severity of urban road crashes. The crash severity model was developed using both machine learning and statistical models because the insights that can be obtained from the latest technology and traditional methods are different. Therefore, the binary logit model, a support vector machine, and extreme gradient boosting were developed using key variables derived from the multiple correspondence analysis and Boruta-SHapley Additive exPlanations. The main result of this study shows that the crash severity decreased at four-street intersections and when traffic segregation facilities were installed. The findings of this study can be used to establish a traffic safety management strategy to reduce the severity of crashes on urban roads.\\n\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The aim of the article. The aim of the article is to search for existing services for writing product descriptions based on artificial intelligence and to compare them in terms of a factor evaluation of key functional and commercial indicators. The results of the analyses. An analysis of seven services utilizing artificial intelligence for automated product description writing has been conducted. The general conclusion is that the use of artificial intelligence for this purpose holds significant potential but poses certain challenges and issues that need to be considered. One notable aspect is the similarity in the quality level of the output text across these services. They all demonstrate approximately similar results, providing text that meets the required standards. This makes them effective tools for integration through APIs in large-scale e-commerce projects with extensive product catalogs. Chat GPT stands out with a high score, particularly due to the multitude of parameters available for use through its API, making it an attractive choice for projects requiring consideration of diverse product characteristics in generated text. Having highlighted the advantages, it is crucial to address the challenges posed by artificial intelligence in the context of writing product descriptions. The primary unresolved issue revolves around the similarity of generated texts for similar products. This problem requires further investigation. In summary, the utilization of artificial intelligence for crafting product descriptions in e-commerce is a promising development direction, enabling time and resource savings. With the right approach and consideration of the specific project's characteristics, services of this kind can become effective tools for optimizing the processes of writing product descriptions in e-commerce. Conclusions and direction for further research. With the rapid growth of the e-commerce market worldwide, the number of products requiring descriptions is increasing exponentially. These descriptions should be well-written to encourage website visitors to make purchases. Producing such a large volume of necessary texts solely by increasing the number of copywriters on a company's payroll is difficult and economically inefficient. Therefore, at this stage of artificial intelligence development, specialized tools have started to emerge that write product descriptions automatically. Although they still have some drawbacks, they are reliable assistants in saving resources for e-commerce enterprises and increasing economic efficiency. A comparison of such services has shown that they are roughly on the same level in terms of writing quality and effectively address the tasks assigned to them. The choice of a specific service will depend on the specific business processes of the enterprises, such as the importance of integrating functionality through APIs. Overall, the level of problem-solving for these services is high, except for one \\u2014 they have not yet overcome uniformity in writing descriptions when similar product characteristics exist. This problem requires further study to find an appropriate practical solution. In addition to the challenges identified, it is essential to emphasize the ethical considerations associated with utilizing artificial intelligence in generating product descriptions. As these systems rely on vast datasets, there is a risk of unintentionally perpetuating biases present in the training data. Ensuring fairness and inclusivity in the language generated by these tools is a critical aspect that demands continuous attention and improvement.\",\n",

Data Science is the most popular technology in the world today, and it's not going away anytime soon. There are many organizations that use data science technologies to solve the mental health problem. There are prediction models built with the help of machine learning and deep learning algorithms. The fact is many developers and medical professionals don't understand the difference between machine learning mental health models and deep learning mental health models. There are different technologies used to solve different metal health problems. This project not only tries to address and solve some of the mental health issues with the help of Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques but also differentiate between the models built with the help of Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques. In this project 4 machine learning models have been used to solve the mental health problem of whether the individual gets the medical attention he/she needs. The techniques used are Logistic Regression, K-Neighbors Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier and Bagging, On the deep learning side of we things a CNN model is built that determines whether the individual is depressed or not depressed.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Although vertical federated learning (VFL) has become a new paradigm of distributed machine learning for emerging multiparty joint modeling applications, how to effectively incentivize self-conscious clients to actively and reliably contribute to collaborative learning in VFL has become a critical issue. Existing efforts are inadequate to address this issue since the training sample size needs to be unified before model training in VFL. To this end, selfish clients should unconditionally and honestly declare their private information, such as model training costs and benefits. However, such an assumption is unrealistic. In this article, we develop the first Truthful incEntive mechAnism for VFL, <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\\\"LaTeX\\\">$\\\\mathbb {TEA}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, to handle both information self-disclosure and social utility maximization. Specifically, we design a transfer payment rule via internalizing externalities, which bundles the clients\\u2019 utilities with the social utility, making truthful reporting by clients be a Nash equilibrium. Theoretically, we prove that <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\\\"LaTeX\\\">$\\\\mathbb {TEA}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> can achieve truthfulness and social utility maximization, as well as budget balance (BB) or individual rationality (IR). On this basis, we further design a sample size decision rule via linear programming (LP) relaxation to meet the requirements of different scenarios. Finally, extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the theoretical properties of <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\\\"LaTeX\\\">$\\\\mathbb {TEA}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> and demonstrate its superiority compared with the state-of-the-art.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The indoor captured raw depth images usually contain large in-homogeneous missing regions. Most existing methods are designed for the outdoor sparse depth completion, which struggle in completing the indoor depth with large holes. In this paper, to solve this problem, we propose a hybrid CNN-Transformer network for RGB guided indoor depth completion. The proposed network is composed of two stages to achieve depth completion in a coarse-to-fine manner. In the first stage, we propose a CNN based self-completion module (SCM) with cross scale attention to restore a coarse depth image. In the second stage, we further refine the completed depth image with the guidance of RGB image by proposing a guided completion module (GCM). To fully explore the guidance from the RGB image, we design a cross-modal Transformer (CMT) block to fuse the features from the depth and RGB modalities at different scales. Extensive experiments on NYUv2 and SUN RGB-D datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method over other state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. The code is available at https://github.com/eecoder-dyf/ICME-2023-depth-completion.\",\n",

Especially for space applications, this is relevant, but even more difficult is it for exploration missions, where the data to be obtained is not known beforehand. To reduce this lack of data, this work proposes a pipeline for automatic realistic data generation for fly-by scenarios such as planned for ESA\\u2019s Comet Interceptor mission. The pipeline consists of two components. First, creating digital models of the nucleus and dust cloud using Blender and second, adding camera artefacts with Python. The camera artefacts considered here are radiation effects, image fractures, pixel errors, thermal noise, and dark current. The goal of the pipeline is to generate realistic data with camera artefacts to supplement the limited available real image footage. Additionally, the synthetic generation of data with random combinations of factors will allow to cover many possible scenarios, for example, irregular body shapes like was observed during ESA\\u2019s Rosetta mission. The generated data will be used to train efficient neural networks to be deployed on-board spacecrafts\\u2019 future processing systems which enable increased data reduction capabilities in space. The pipeline is also designed to create data to verify the system\\u2019s behaviour in certain scenarios.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Binary decomposition of a multi-class classification problem is a widely used method in the field of machine learning, which involves using an ensemble of binary classifiers to undertake multi-class classification tasks. The motivation of binary decomposition lies in two main aspects. Firstly, some learning algorithms such as support vector machine can not achieve directly learning a multi-class classifier. Secondly, in some cases, the adoption of binary decomposition for training an ensemble of binary classifiers can even achieve better performance than the direct learning of a multi-class classifier. There are some existing methods that can be applied in achieving binary decomposition and have been proven to be effective. Some of these methods may also be applied in other tasks beyond classification. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the development and applications of binary decomposition methods. Specifically, these methods are put into two categories, namely, ordered and unordered decomposition, which each is introduced in terms of the essence and strategies of decomposition. These methods are also compared through theoretical analysis of their effectiveness and efficiency. On the basis of the comparative analysis, we suggest some future directions towards achieving further advances in binary decomposition.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"InsurTech is a new and interesting phenomenon, linked to the use of new technologies, such as artificial intelligence or distributed ledger technology, in the insurance sector. The factual and legal nature of relationships in this area, due to their heterogeneous and complex international character, raises many questions. Some of these relate to private international law, where conflict situations raise questions such as which law (the law of which state) is the substantive law applicable to resolve these situations. Presenting the complexity of this area, this statement describes possible solutions and reflects on the need and potential of applying private international law in the InsurTech sector. It introduces the InsurTech phenomenon, presents its links with private international law, reflects on the adaptability of existing mechanisms of this law to highly technological legal relations, and concludes by an attempt to indicate how to combine InsurTech and private international law, and whether this is possible at all.The work was written using standard scientific methods for legal science. It is primarily a dogmatic work, but also reaches for comparative legal elements. This choice of methods is justified by the presented issues.The result of the research is an assessment as to the possible use of private international law tools for the problems that arise with InsurTech instruments.The author points out that the currently known private international law instruments are not suited to the modern requirements of the insurance services sector, especially in the context of the use of artificial intelligence or DLT technology (blockchain, smart contract) in the sector.\",\n",

This process is carried out to improve the quality of imaging while preserving all the essential and distinct features. Many areas such as Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Image Processing, and Computer Vision are covered by Medical Image Fusion. This method has been adopted on a large scale by physicians to apprehend any damage or injury caused in organ tissues in clinical trials by performing a fusion of images with different modalities. In this review, Deep Learning methods carried out in the medical image fusion field have been discussed along with a comparison between their accuracies. The main objective of this paper is to list some of the most effective techniques in this domain and discuss their performance. At last, the paper concludes with the fact that although the development and growth in this area have increased over the years, many challenges have also come along the way.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Regression test selection (RTS) speeds up regression testing by only re-running tests that might be affected by code changes. Ideal RTS safely selects all affected tests and precisely selects only affected tests. But, aiming for this ideal is often slower than re-running all tests. So, recent RTS techniques use program analysis to trade precision for speed, i.e., lower regression testing time, or even use machine learning to trade safety for speed. We seek to make recent analysis-based RTS techniques more precise, to further speed up regression testing. Independent studies suggest that these techniques reached a \\u201cperformance wall\\u201d in the speed-ups that they provide. We manually inspect code changes to discover those that do not require re-running tests that are only affected by such changes. We categorize 29 kinds of changes that we find from five projects into 13 findings, 11 of which are semantics-modifying. We enhance two RTS techniques---Ekstazi and STARTS---to reason about our findings. Using 1,150 versions of 23 projects, we evaluate the impact on safety and precision of leveraging such changes. We also evaluate if our findings from a few projects can speed up regression testing in other projects. The results show that our enhancements are effective and they can generalize. On average, they result in selecting 41.7% and 31.8% fewer tests, and take 33.7% and 28.7% less time than Ekstazi and STARTS, respectively, with no loss in safety.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Poverty is known to be the mother of all crimes, and a vast percentage of people in India live below the poverty line. In India, the crime rate is rapidly rising. The police officers must spend a significant amount of time and personnel to identify suspects and criminals using current crime investigation. In this research, the method presented for designing and implementing crime identification and criminal recognition systems for Indian metropolitans is utilizing techniques of data mining. These occurrences are represented by 35 predefined crime attributes. Access to the crime database is protected by safeguards. The pending four subjects are important for crime unmasking, identification and estimation of criminals, and crime authentication, in that order. The detection of crime is investigated with the help of K-Means clustering, which iteratively builds two crime batches based on congruent criminal features. Google Maps is to enhance the k-means visualization. K-Nearest Neighbor classification is used to examine criminal identification and forecasting. This is used for the authentication of the results. The technique benefits society by helping investigative authorities in crime solving and criminal recognition, resulting in lower crime rates. This research study describes a way for creating and deploying crime solving and criminal recognition systems for Indian metro's using data mining tools in this study. The method consists of data evulsion, data pre- processing, clustering, Google map delegation and classification. The first module, data evulsion, retrieves unformed or unrecorded crime datasets from several criminal sources online from 2000 to 2012. In the second module, Data pre-processing cleans, assimilates, and reduces the obtained criminal data into organized 5,038 crime occurrences. Several predefined criminal traits represent these instances. Safeguards are in place to prevent unauthorized access to the crime index. The remaining components are critical for detecting crimes, criminal identity and prediction, and crime verification, in that sequence. The investigation of crimes is investigated using k-means clustering, which gives results repeatedly.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"ABSTRACT Brain tumours are produced by the uncontrolled, and unusual tissue growth of brain. Because of the wide range of brain tumour locations, potential shapes, and image intensities, segmentation of the brain tumour by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is challenging. In this research, the deep learning (DL)-enabled brain tumour detection is developed by hybrid optimization method. The pre-processing stage used adaptive Wiener filter for minimizing the noise from input image. After that, the abnormal section of the image is segmented using U-Net. Afterwards, the data augmentation is accomplished to recover the random erasing, brightness, and translation characters. The statistical, shape, and texture features are extracted in feature extraction process. In first-level classification, the abnormal section of the image is sensed as brain tumour or not. Here, the Red Deer Tasmanian Devil Optimization (RDTDO) trained DenseNet is hired for brain tumour detection process. If tumour is identified, then second-level classification provides the brain tumour classification, where deep residual network (DRN)-enabled RDTDO is employed. Furthermore, the system performance is assessed by accuracy, true positive rate (TPR), true negative rate (TNR), positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) with the maximum values of 0.947, 0.926, 0.950, 0.937, and 0.926 are attained.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Recent years have seen a growing interest in the use of smart glasses mounted with microphones to solve the cocktail party problem using beamforming techniques or machine learning. Many such approaches could bring substantial advances in hearing aid or Augmented Reality (AR) research. To validate these methods, the EasyCom [Donley et al., 2021] dataset introduced high-quality multi-modal recordings of conversations in noise, including egocentric multi-channel microphone array audio, speech source pose, and headset microphone audio. While providing comprehensive data, EasyCom lacks diversity in the acoustic environments considered and the degree of overlapping speech in conversations. This work therefore presents the Group in Noise (GiN) dataset of over 2 hours of group conversations in noisy environments recorded using binaural microphones and a pair of glasses mounted with 5 microphones. The recordings took place in 3 rooms and contain 6 seated participants as well as a standing facilitator. The data also include close-talking microphone audio and head-pose data for each speaker, an audio channel from a fixed reference microphone, and automatically annotated speaker activity information. A baseline method is used to demonstrate the use of the data for speech enhancement. The dataset is publicly available in d'Olne et al. [2023].\",\n",

However, most microclimate studies are temperature-centric, and do not consider meteorological factors such as sunshine, hail and snow. Meanwhile, remote cameras have become a primary tool to monitor wild plants and animals, even at micro-scales, with deep learning tools to rapidly convert images into ecological data. However, deep learning applications for wildlife imagery have focused exclusively on living subjects. Here, we identify an overlooked opportunity to extract latent, yet ecologically relevant, meteorological information. We produce an annotated image dataset of micrometeorological conditions across 49 wildlife cameras in South Africa\\u2019s Maloti-Drakensberg and the Swiss Alps. We train ensemble deep learning models to classify conditions as overcast, sunshine, hail or snow. Our best model achieves 91.7% accuracy on test cameras not seen during training. Furthermore, we show how effective accuracy is raised to 96% by disregarding 14.1% of classifications where ensemble member models did not reach a consensus. Unlike previous studies we test model performance in remote and novel locations, distinguishing overcast and sunny conditions in Svalbard, Norway with 79.3% accuracy (93.9% consensus accuracy). Our model rapidly classifies sunshine, snow and hail in almost 2 million unlabeled images. Resulting micrometeorological data illustrated common seasonal patterns of summer hailstorms and autumn snowfalls across mountains in the northern and southern hemispheres. However, daily patterns of sunshine and shade diverged between sites, impacting daily temperature cycles. Crucially, we leverage micrometeorological data to demonstrate that (1) experimental warming using open-top chambers shortens early snow events in autumn, and (2) image-derived sunshine marginally outperforms sensor-derived temperature when predicting bumblebee foraging. These methods generate novel micrometeorological variables in synchrony with biological recordings, enabling new insights from an increasingly global network of wildlife cameras.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Large-scale conversational systems typically rely on a skill-routing component to route a user request to an appropriate skill and interpretation to serve the request. In such system, the agent is responsible for serving thousands of skills and interpretations which create a long-tail distribution due to the natural frequency of requests. For example, the samples related to play music might be a thousand times more frequent than those asking for theatre show times. Moreover, inputs used for ML-based skill routing are often a heterogeneous mix of strings, embedding vectors, categorical and scalar features which makes employing augmentation-based long-tail learning approaches challenging. To improve the skill-routing robustness, we propose an augmentation of heterogeneous skill-routing data and training targeted for robust operation in long-tail data regimes. We explore a variety of conditional encoder-decoder generative frameworks to perturb original data fields and create synthetic training data. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments using real-world data from a commercial conversational system. Based on the experiment results, the proposed approach improves more than 80% (51 out of 63) of intents with less than 10K of traffic instances in the skill-routing replication task.\",\n",

However, a major disadvantage of ferry services is that it is crucially affected by weather conditions. Thus, informing customers about regular ferry service operations is important. Considering this, This study aims to predict whether ferry services can be provided in a timely manner through machine learning approaches with their meteorological (6\\u201348 h prior) and operation datasets. The results indicate that a random forest classifier achieves accuracy levels of 90.50% (6 h) and 88.78% (48 h) in timely ferry services, which are greater than the regulation-oriented determination. Both implications and limitations are presented based on the findings of the current study.\",\n",

Particularly noteworthy is the transition to digital substations, which is shifting operations from traditional hardwired-based systems to communication-based Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system operations. These changes in the power system have increased the vulnerability of the system to cyber-attacks and emphasized its importance. This paper proposes a machine learning (ML) based post event analysis of the power system in order to respond to these cybersecurity issues. An artificial neural network (ANN) and other ML models are trained using transient fault measurements and cyber-attack data on substations. The trained models can successfully distinguish between power system faults and cyber-attacks. Furthermore, the results of the proposed ML-based methods can also identify 10 different fault types and the location where the event occurred.\",\n",

However, extending to general-purpose vision-language models is challenging due to the distributional diversity in visual inputs. A recent line of work explores vision-language instruction tuning, taking inspiration from the Query Transformer (QFormer) approach proposed in BLIP-2 models for bridging frozen modalities. However, these approaches rely heavily on large-scale multi-modal pretraining for representation learning before eventual finetuning, incurring a huge computational overhead, poor scaling, and limited accessibility. To that end, we propose a more efficient method for QFormer-based vision-language alignment and demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy compared to existing baselines in improving the efficiency of vision-language pretraining.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Emotion recognition using deep learning methods through electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis has marked significant progress. Nevertheless, the complexities and time-intensive nature of EEG analysis present challenges. This study proposes an efficient EEG analysis method that foregoes feature extraction and sliding windows, instead employing one-dimensional Neural Networks for emotion classification. The analysis utilizes EEG signals from the Database for Emotion Analysis using Physiological Signals (DEAP) and focuses on thirteen EEG electrode positions closely associated with emotion changes. Three distinct Neural Models are explored for emotion classification: two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and a combined approach using Convolutional Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM). Additionally, two emotion labels are considered: four emotional ranges encompassing low arousal and low valence (LALV), low arousal and high valence (LAHV), high arousal and high valence (HAHV), and high arousal and low valence (HALV); and high valence (HV) and low valence (LV). Results demonstrate CNN_1 achieving an average accuracy of 97.7% for classifying four emotional ranges, CNN_2 with 97.1%, and CNN-LSTM reaching an impressive 99.5%. Notably, in classifying HV and LV labels, our methods attained remarkable accuracies of 100%, 98.8%, and 99.7% for CNN_1, CNN_2, and CNN-LSTM, respectively. The performance of our models surpasses that of previously reported studies, showcasing their potential as highly effective classifiers for emotion recognition using EEG signals.\",\n",

Within the United Kingdom, the capacity for the Emergency Services to be interoperable has been criticized by public enquiries. This systematic review had three goals to: (i) define interoperability; (ii) identify the structural principles that underpin interoperability and (iii) identify the psychological principles that outline how interoperability can be achieved. A PRISMA framework was used to identify 137 articles, including 94 articles from the systematic review, 15 articles from grey literature and 28 articles based on author expertise. We identified two structural principles of interoperability: (i) being able to communicate and exchange information effectively; and (ii) having a decentralized and flexible team network. We identified three psychological principles that informed how interoperability might be embedded in the team: (i) establishing trust between team members; (ii) developing secure team identities and (iii) building cohesive goals. We defined interoperability as a shared system of technology and teamwork built upon trust, identification, goals, communication and flexibility. Regular psychologically immersive training that targets these psychological principles will help to embed interoperability into the social fabric of multi\\u2010team systems operating in high\\u2010reliability organizations.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"In this paper, a method to generate speech from a muted video is proposed. Recent advances in computer vision and deep learning have allowed the development of lip-reading technology that can recognize and interpret lip movements in videos. However, one of the main challenges in visual-to-speech synthesis is distinguishing between homophenes, or sets of words that look identical on a person's lips but contain different sounds. To address this challenge, the proposed model utilizes a speech generation framework that uses an external memory called Visual Audio Recall (VA-Recall) to generate speech from silent video. The VA-Recall system allows the system to effectively synthesize speech from a speaker by recalling the most relevant auditory information that matches the visual input context. The proposed method further generates subtitles for the reconstructed audio. Overall, this process allows for a more natural and contextually appropriate speech synthesis system.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Ophthalmic diseases like glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and cataracts are the main cause of visual impairment worldwide. With the use of the fundus images, it could be difficult for a clinician to detect eye diseases early enough. By other hand, the diagnoses of eye disease are prone to errors, challenging and labor-intensive. Thus, for the purpose of identifying various eye problems with the use of the fundus images, a system of automated ocular disease detection with computer-assisted tools is needed. Due to machine learning (ML) algorithms' advanced skills for image classification, this kind of system is feasible. An essential area of artificial intelligence)AI (is machine learning. Ophthalmologists will soon be able to deliver accurate diagnoses and support individualized healthcare thanks to the general capacity of machine learning to automatically identify, find, and grade pathological aspects in ocular disorders. This work presents a ML-based method for targeted ocular detection. The Ocular Disease Intelligent Recognition (ODIR) dataset, which includes 5,000 images of 8 different fundus types, was classified using machine learning methods. Various ocular diseases are represented by these classes. In this study, the dataset was divided into 70% training data and 30% test data, and preprocessing operations were performed on all images starting from color image conversion to grayscale, histogram equalization, BLUR, and resizing operation. The feature extraction represents the next phase in this study ,two algorithms are applied to perform the extraction of features which includes: SIFT(Scale-invariant feature transform) and GLCM(Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix), ODIR dataset is then subjected to the classification techniques Na\\u00efve Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and K-nearest Neighbor. This study achieved the highest accuracy for binary classification (abnormal and normal) which is 75% (NB algorithm), 62% (RF algorithm), 53% (KNN algorithm), 51% (DT algorithm) and achieved the highest accuracy for multiclass classification (types of eye diseases) which is 88% (RF algorithm), 61% (KNN algorithm) 42% (NB algorithm), and 39% (DT algorithm).\",\n",

While some methods to manipulate and interpret speech date back many decades (e.g., Fourier analysis), other processing techniques were developed late last century (e.g., linear predictive coding and hidden Markov models). Nonetheless, the last 25 years have seen major advances leading to the wide acceptance of computer-based speech processing, e.g., cellular telephones and real-time online conversations. This paper reviews older techniques and recent methods that focus largely on artificial neural networks. The major highlights in speech research are examined, without delving into mathematical detail, while giving insight into the research choices that have been made.

Authentic users only access and edit medical records, any alteration in the medical records may result in a misdiagnosis and, as a result, harm the patient's life. Biometric method and watermarking modes are utilized to satisfy goal, such as Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Least Significant Bit (LSB). In this work focused on a biometric watermarking system where the iris code of the sender programmed as a sender authentication key. The confidentiality of the patient information is safeguarded via encrypting it with an XOR algorithm and embedding the key in the DCT image. The algorithm has demonstrated which is suggested system has met earlier constraints. We used samples of original watermarked images with PSNR value, embedding time and extraction time, the lowest embedding time was 0.0709 and the PSNR value was 49.2369.\",\n",

Two paradigms are considered, based on artificial neural networks (ANN) and \\u2013 the second one \\u2013 based on particle swarm optimization (PSO). The first approach promotes linear neural networks architecture, ADALINE for single signals and MADALINE for multiple signals case. The second approach promotes the swarm intelligence, used here for the minimization of objective function based on mean squared error (MSE). For periodic signals, the trigonometric Fourier series is considered. For aperiodic signals, the discrete Fourier transform is promoted. Both techniques could be applied for a more general problem of model parameter estimation. The computer-based experiments are made with various signal-to-noise ratios, to study the effects on the converge rate on the estimation process. At least for the considered signals, the ANN based solution provides better results. The framework could be extended to the analysis problem based on other base functions, e.g., wavelets.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"In the post-epidemic era, the employment situation has become increasingly serious, and job-hunting reality shows have innovated significantly to meet the current market demand. Given the diverse nature of the live context involved in these programs, it is crucial for the hosts to possess strong improvisational speech skills. However, some hosts struggle to effectively handle the various scenarios presented in the program, leading to ineffective communication. Therefore, this study focuses on the TV show \\u201cIt\\u2019s You\\u201d as the research corpus and employs discourse control acts theory, discourse analysis, and descriptive statistics to examine the patterns of impromptu speech initiation by the hosts of this job-seeking reality show. In this study, the job-hunting reality show is divided into three stages, with the second stage, known as the multiple interaction stage, chosen as the focus of the analysis. Within this stage, two situational contexts are identified and a total of seven initiation words and twelve initiation sentences are summarized. Furthermore, quantitative statistics are conducted by considering the initiation object and initiation position. Based on the findings, two distinct expression patterns are identified: the suit deepening + derivative penetration + intersectional embedding mode, and the continuity + insertion jump + homeopathic deepening mode.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is being investigated as a competitive alternative to traditional techniques for solving network optimization problems. A promising research direction lies in enhancing traditional optimization algorithms by offloading low-level decisions to a DRL agent. In this study, we consider how to effectively employ DRL to improve the performance of Local Search algorithms, i.e., algorithms that, starting from a candidate solution, explore the solution space by iteratively applying local changes (i.e., moves), yielding the best solution found in the process. We propose a Local Search algorithm based on lightweight Deep Reinforcement Learning (DeepLS) that, given a neighborhood, queries a DRL agent for choosing a move, with the goal of achieving the best objective value in the long term. Our DRL agent, based on permutation-equivariant neural networks, is composed by less than a hundred parameters, requiring only up to ten minutes of training and can evaluate problem instances of arbitrary size, generalizing to networks and traffic distributions unseen during training. We evaluate DeepLS on two illustrative NP-Hard network routing problems, namely OSPF Weight Setting and Routing and Wavelength Assignment, training on a single small network only and evaluating on instances 2x-10x larger than training. Experimental results show that DeepLS outperforms existing DRL-based approaches from literature and attains competitive results with state-of-the-art metaheuristics, with computing times up to 8x smaller than the strongest algorithmic baselines.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Air traffic control (ATC) is a safety-critical service system that demands constant attention from ground air traffic controllers (ATCos) to maintain daily aviation operations. The workload of the ATCos can have negative effects on operational safety and airspace usage. To avoid overloading and ensure an acceptable workload level for the ATCos, it is important to predict the ATCos' workload accurately for mitigation actions. In this paper, we first perform a review of research on ATCo workload, mostly from the air traffic perspective. Then, we briefly introduce the setup of the human-in-the-loop (HITL) simulations with retired ATCos, where the air traffic data and workload labels are obtained. The simulations are conducted under three Phoenix approach scenarios while the human ATCos are requested to self-evaluate their workload ratings (i.e., low-1 to high-7). Preliminary data analysis is conducted. Next, we propose a graph-based deep-learning framework with conformal prediction to identify the ATCo workload levels. The number of aircraft under the controller's control varies both spatially and temporally, resulting in dynamically evolving graphs. The experiment results suggest that (a) besides the traffic density feature, the traffic conflict feature contributes to the workload prediction capabilities (i.e., minimum horizontal/vertical separation distance); (b) directly learning from the spatiotemporal graph layout of airspace with graph neural network can achieve higher prediction accuracy, compare to hand-crafted traffic complexity features; (c) conformal prediction is a valuable tool to further boost model prediction accuracy, resulting a range of predicted workload labels.

      "      \"abstract\": \"We present the design and the implementation of a kernel principal component regression software that handles training datasets with a million or more observations. Kernel regressions are nonlinear and interpretable models that have wide downstream applications, and are shown to have a close connection to deep learning. Nevertheless, the exact regression of large-scale kernel models using currently available software has been notoriously difficult because it is both compute and memory intensive and it requires extensive tuning of hyperparameters. While in computational science distributed computing and iterative methods have been a mainstay of large scale software, they have not been widely adopted in kernel learning. Our software leverages existing high performance computing (HPC) techniques and develops new ones that address cross-cutting constraints between HPC and learning algorithms. It integrates three major components: (a) a state-of-the-art parallel eigenvalue iterative solver, (b) a block matrix-vector multiplication routine that employs both multi-threading and distributed memory parallelism and can be performed on-the-fly under limited memory, and (c) a software pipeline consisting of Python front-ends that control the HPC backbone and the hyperparameter optimization through a boosting optimizer. We perform feasibility studies by running the entire ImageNet dataset and a large asset pricing dataset.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"With the rapid growth in foreign trade business and the continuous expansion of customs functions, the amount of data obtained by customs monitoring systems has drastically increased, and risk management techniques have been widely used in the customs field. Risk assessment, as an important part of risk management, can help departments of customs to understand the possibility and impact of risks in advance. Assessing the risks of import and export enterprises is an important task for customs. However, the assessment is challenging because of the large-scale of data, rapidly changing information, and inherent fuzziness. To address this issue, this survey summarizes the existing risk assessment methods, combines the preliminaries of fuzzy logic and neural networks, and applies the representative risk assessment models in the risk assessment of import and export enterprises. The risk assessment models based on fuzzy logic and neural networks can handle vague and uncertain data and improve the efficiency of risk assessment through adaptive and learning capabilities. The combination of theoretical and simple case suggests that the risk assessment method based on fuzzy logic and neural networks has good feasibility for import and export enterprises, and provides valuable references for developing effective risk assessment models of import and export enterprises in the future.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Automatic voice authentication based on deep learning is a promising technology that has received much attention\\nfrom academia and industry. It has proven to be effective in a variety of applications, including biometric access control\\nsystems. Using biometric data in such systems is difficult, particularly in a centralized setting. It introduces numerous risks,\\nsuch as information disclosure, unreliability, security, privacy, etc. Voice authentication systems are becoming increasingly\\nimportant in solving these issues. This is especially true if the device relies on voice commands from the user. This work\\ninvestigates the development of a text-independent voice authentication system. The spatial features of the voiceprint\\n(corresponding to the speech spectrum) are present in the speech signal as a result of the spectrogram, and the weighted wavelet\\npacket cepstral coefficients (W-WPCC) are effective for spatial feature extraction (corresponding to the speech spectrum). W-\\nWPCC characteristics are calculated by combining sub-band energies with sub-band spectral centroids using a weighting\\nscheme to generate noise-resistant acoustic characteristics. In addition, this work proposes an enhanced inception v3 model for\\nvoice authentication. The proposed InceptionV3 system extracts feature from input data from the convolutional and pooling\\nlayers. By employing fewer parameters, this architecture reduces the complexity of the convolution process while increasing\\nlearning speed. Following model training, the enhanced Inception v3 model classifies audio samples as authenticated or not\\nbased on extracted features. Experiments were carried out on the speech of five English speakers whose voices were collected\\nfrom YouTube. The results reveal that the suggested improved method, based on enhanced Inception v3 and trained on speech\\nspectrogram pictures, outperforms the existing methods. The approach generates tests with an average categorization accuracy\\nof 99%. Compared to the performance of these network models on the given dataset, the proposed enhanced Inception v3\\nnetwork model achieves the best results regarding model training time, recognition accuracy, and stability.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Up to now, it still remains an open question about the relation between the structure of brain networks and their functions. The effects of structure on the dynamics of neural networks are usually investigated via extensive numerical simulations, while analytical analysis is always very difficult and thus rare. In this work, we explored the effects of a random regular graph on the dynamics of a neural network of stochastic spiking neurons, which has a bistable region when fully connected. We showed by numerical simulations that as the number of each neuron's neighbors decreases, the bistable region shrinks and eventually seems to disappear, and a critical-like transition appears. In the meantime, we made analytical analysis that explains numerical results. We hope this would give some insights into how structure affects the dynamics of neural networks from a theoretical perspective, rather than merely by numerical simulations.\",\n",

Rooted in the stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R) theory, this study investigated how streamer attributes influence user stickiness.Design/methodology/approachThe authors obtained 496 valid samples from Chinese live e-commerce users and explored the formation of user stickiness using partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Artificial neural network (ANN) was used to capture linear and non-linear relationships and analyze the normalized importance ranking of significant variables, supplementing the PLS-SEM results.FindingsThe authors found that attractiveness and similarity positively impacted parasocial interaction (PSI). Expertise and trustworthiness positively impacted perceived information quality. Moreover, streamer-brand preference mediated the relationship between PSI and user stickiness, as well as the relationship between perceived information quality and user stickiness. Compared to PLS-SEM, the predictive ability of ANN was more robust. Further, the results of PLS-SEM and ANN both showed that attractiveness was the strongest predictor of user stickiness.Originality/valueThis study explained how streamer attributes affect user stickiness and provided a reference value for future research on user behavior in live e-commerce. The exploration of the linear and non-linear relationships between variables based on ANN supplements existing research. Moreover, the results of this study have implications for practitioners on how to improve user stickiness and contribute to the development of the livestreaming industry.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Background\\nPredicting the risk of osteoporotic fractures is vital for prevention. Traditional methods such as the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) model use clinical factors. This study examined the predictive power of the FRAX score and machine-learning algorithms trained on FRAX parameters.\\n\\n\\nMethods\\nWe analyzed the data of 2,147 female participants from the Ansan cohort study. The FRAX parameters employed in this study included age, sex (female), height and weight, current smoking status, excessive alcohol consumption (>3 units/d of alcohol), and diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. Osteoporotic fracture was defined as one or more fractures of the hip, spine, or wrist during a 10-year observation period. Machine-learning algorithms, such as gradient boosting, random forest, decision tree, and logistic regression, were employed to predict osteoporotic fractures with a 70:30 training-to-test set ratio. We evaluated the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) scores to assess and compare the performance of these algorithms with the FRAX score.\\n\\n\\nResults\\nOf the 2,147 participants, 3.5% experienced osteoporotic fractures. Those with fractures were older, shorter in height, and had a higher prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis, as well as higher FRAX scores. The AUROC for the FRAX was 0.617. The machine-learning algorithms showed AUROC values of 0.662, 0.652, 0.648, and 0.637 for gradient boosting, logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest, respectively.\\n\\n\\nConclusion\\nThis study highlighted the immense potential of machine-learning algorithms to improve osteoporotic fracture risk prediction in women when complete FRAX parameter information is unavailable.\",\n",

      "      \"title\": \"Optical switching will innovate intra data center networks [Invited Tutorial]\",\n",
      "      \"abstract\": \"Reflecting the recent slow-down in Moore\\u2019s law and the proliferation of artificial intelligence/machine learning workloads, the performance and energy consumption of networks are becoming barriers in high-performance computing (HPC) and data centers. Optical switches are expected to break these barriers, and indeed their introduction has recently commenced in data centers. This paper discusses how optical switching technologies can innovate future intra data center networks. Hyperscale data centers are much bigger in scale, and network requirements are slightly different from those of HPC. This paper focus on data center networks, since the impact of optical technologies will be more significant in data centers than in HPC. In addition to the scale issue, important metrics to be considered for network design are traffic characteristics and latency, both of which are highlighted in this paper. For hybrid (electrical packet and optical circuit) switching networks, the target latency for the optical circuit switch network (connection setup/teardown time) is shown to be around 10 \\u00b5s, and the needed technologies are clarified and verified by experiments. The optical switch can simplify the present multi-tier switching network above tier-1 switches into a single tier configuration, which is possible with the development of efficient large port count optical switches. Among the different switching architectures, combining the different dimensions of space and wavelength is shown to be one of the best solutions. Fast switching needs fast device response time. Si photonics devices using Mach\\u2013Zehnder interferometers or ring-resonator-based switches and tunable filters are the most promising candidates; they offer cost-effective mass-production and fast operation and so are excellent candidates for the optical switches envisaged. Another critical technology to maximize the benefits of optical switches is a simple and low-latency control mechanism. Different approaches have been suggested as summarized in this work. Among them, harnessing optical switch parallelism is a unique technique that matches recent advances in electrical switch chips. A fast control network is realized by using a fully decentralized and asynchronous control mechanism. A hyperscale data center offers a wide variety of services, and no one system fits all needs. Optimization of parameters is an important task for maximizing the impact of optical switching in different kinds of data centers.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"This study proposes a comprehensive measure of Euroscepticism through textual analysis of parliamentary speeches. This innovative approach offers direct insights into politicians' attitudes towards European integration, enabling quantification of the intensity of Eurosceptic sentiments. We leverage advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including supervised classification and transfer learning. The objectives of this research are three-fold: a) to introduce a novel method for measuring Euroscepticism using advanced NLP techniques and machine learning models, b) to compare the predictive performance of these various techniques for the task at hand, and c) to mitigate, to the extent possible, the inherent difficulties and limitations of crowdsourced data annotation when the process requires expert knowledge. Results indicate that in the absence of a humanly curated annotated dataset, GPT outperforms other approaches (F1 score 0.74). On the contrary, when such a dataset exists, Few-Shot classification proves to be the optimal solution (F1 0.87). These findings pave the way for a more accurate assessment of Euroscepticism and potentially other political phenomena, through the innovative use of NLP techniques.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"\\n Background: Prostate cancer (PCa) is highly heterogeneous, and while some tumors remain indolent throughout a patient's lifetime, others are highly aggressive, leading to significant morbidity and death. The current methods for PCa diagnosis and prognosis are highly suboptimal, resulting in over-diagnosis and overtreatment of many clinically insignificant tumors. To understand the nature of PCa heterogeneity, we conducted comprehensive genomic analyses on matched samples of adjacent normal prostate tissue, prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), and invasive PCa. Methods: To investigate the changes cells undergo during PCa development and progression, we analyzed genomic and transcriptomic alterations in 92 adjacent normal, 80 PIN, and 99 PCa samples from 34 patients. For each sample type, both epithelial and stromal components were analyzed separately using laser capture microdissection of formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue. Transcriptomic analysis was performed using smart3-SEQ and copy number analysis was performed by low-pass whole genome sequencing (WGS). The samples were analyzed as three separate data sets. Results: We studied the spectrum of molecular changes present in both epithelial and stromal samples. A negative-binomial regression model was used to identify differentially expressed genes between adjacent normal prostate tissue and invasive PCa in epithelium and stroma separately using the discovery data set. The resulting gene lists were used to perform non-negative matrix factorization clustering of all samples in the three datasets separately. This analysis identified two epithelial and two stromal clusters with distinct RNA expression profiles in all three data sets. For invasive PCa samples, all except three epithelial samples and five stromal samples clustered in the \\u2018invasive-like\\u2019 clusters. Similarly for adjacent normal samples, all except three of the epithelial and six of the stromal samples clustered as \\u2018normal-like\\u2019 across the three datasets. For PIN samples, 54% of epithelial and 62% of stromal samples classified as \\u2018normal-like\\u2019. We performed phylogenetic analysis of WGS data and identified PIN lesions with and without clear clonal relation to invasive PCa lesions. Recurrent copy number variations were identified in both PIN and PCa lesions. Conclusion. We identified two distinct epithelial and two distinct stromal expression clusters with \\u2018invasive-like\\u2019 and \\u2018normal-like\\u2019 signatures. WGS analysis revealed recurrent copy number alterations in PIN and PCa lesions, and evidence of clonal relationships between PIN and invasive PCa. These studies provide new insight into PIN biology and the relationship between PIN and invasive PCa.\\n Citation Format: Siri H.

      "      \"abstract\": \"The power system complexity and associated stability problems are greatly linked to the increasing penetration of unconventional energy sources and loads, such as renewable energies. The application of renewable for climate change, sustainability, and Net Zero come at the cost of deteriorated power quality, faults, instability, and disturbances in the power system. It gives rise to various problems such as equipment malfunctioning, power factor problems, transformer heating, inertia, voltage sags/swells, transmission lines overloading, etc. This requires and adjudicates the need for efficient monitoring and identification of faults and anomalies happening in the power system so as to accordingly mitigate these in a timely manner. The fault data however is not readily available and requires on-site inspection and accumulation. This paper thus aims at developing a synthetic database for various abnormal power system conditions captured from a well-known Kundr\\u2019s two-area system. These include symmetrical and asymmetrical faults, frequency, and phase variations, as well as voltage amplitude disturbances (sag/swell). The synthetic database is then combined with artificial intelligence techniques to enable fault detection and identification featuring low linear complexity and small memory requirements. The paper includes a benchmark study for three unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms, evaluating their performance in terms of both Area under the ROC Curve (AUC) and the execution time. The results show that iForest and iNNE provide competitive results in detecting anomalies of all fault types, with iNNE providing significantly better execution time performance.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"With the staggering growth of data on modern IoT devices, privacy concerns on IoT networks are becoming increasingly prominent. Thus, federated learning emerged. It trains the model by enabling multiple participants to employ data from multiple parties, making data accessible but not visible. However, user data may encounter issues with data privacy leakage in the existing federated learning environment. Thus, this article suggests BFLPP, a privacy protection federated learning framework based on blockchain and committee consensus in IoT devices. It leverages blockchain to verify local updates, rather than a centralized server and uses it to generate and store global models. It also implements local differential privacy to further secure data privacy. In this paper, we use committee nodes to validate the model parameters, and if we receive enough replies during the validation process. It will submit and upload the validated updates to the update block, then trigger the smart contract to aggregate updates and broadcast it to the nodes for the next training round. Eventually, this paper employs the BFLPP framework on convolutional neural networks to conduct experiments on the MNIST dataset, grounded on blockchain and federated learning. The experimental results indicate the security and effectiveness of the BFLPP framework.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Existing therapies for neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's address only their symptoms and do not prevent disease onset. Common therapeutic agents, such as small molecules and antibodies struggle with insufficient selectivity, stability and bioavailability, leading to poor performance in clinical trials. Peptide-based therapeutics are emerging as promising candidates, with successful applications for cardiovascular diseases and cancers due to their high bioavailability, good efficacy and specificity. In particular, cyclic peptides have a long in vivo stability, while maintaining a robust antibody-like binding affinity. However, the de novo design of cyclic peptides is challenging due to the lack of long-lived druggable pockets of the target polypeptide, absence of exhaustive conformational distributions of the target and/or the binder, unknown binding site, methodological limitations, associated constraints (failed trials, time, money) and the vast combinatorial sequence space. Hence, efficient alignment and cooperation between disciplines, and synergies between experiments and simulations complemented by popular techniques like machine-learning can significantly speed up the therapeutic cyclic-peptide development for neurodegenerative diseases. We review the latest advancements in cyclic peptide design against amyloidogenic targets from a computational perspective in light of recent advancements and potential of machine learning to optimize the design process. We discuss the difficulties encountered when designing novel peptide-based inhibitors and we propose new strategies incorporating experiments, simulations and machine learning to design cyclic peptides to inhibit the toxic propagation of amyloidogenic polypeptides. Importantly, these strategies extend beyond the mere design of cyclic peptides and serve as template for the de novo generation of (bio)materials with programmable properties.\",\n",

It results in decreased quality of life and increased mortality, and there are currently no effective treatments. To better understand cachexia, we aimed to profile protein heterogeneity seen in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) mouse models with cachexia. Since muscle is a readily available protein resource during catabolism, we hypothesize there are significant changes in protein sequence and post-translational modifications (PTMs) of muscle proteins during cachexia progression. As these proteins are scavenged, precise analysis of sequence variation can identify the exact mechanism of protein/muscle breakdown and better elucidate the molecular processes of PDAC-induced cachexia. \\nExperimental Design:We performed bioinformatic analysis of two proteomics datasets of cardiac and skeletal muscle samples from PDAC-induced cachexia mouse models. Two proteomics software algorithms, SEQUEST (within Proteome Discoverer (PD)) and PEAKS (a machine-learning algorithm), were used to identify all sample proteins and their PTMs. Because PEAKS can identify more PTMs than PD, we compared the most abundant proteins identified in PD and PEAKS, hypothesizing PEAKS would yield greater protein sequence coverage. Finally, we compiled unpublished PTMs and protein processing events for 25 of the most abundant proteins in both datasets. \\nResults:Notably, PEAKS reported greater sequence coverage for cardiac muscle than PD, while the skeletal muscle sample had similar coverage in both algorithms. This discrepancy may suggest cachectic processes degrade skeletal muscle at a greater rate than cardiac muscle, preventing PEAKS from increasing skeletal muscle sequence coverage relative to PD. In addition, several unpublished modifications, including those of actin and acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase, were recorded. \\nPotential Impact:These newly discovered protein modifications may indicate previously unknown molecular processes in the course of PDAC-induced cachexia. These modifications may serve as cornerstones of future research to identify novel therapeutic targets in cachexia treatment.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) constitute the basis of Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) underpinning sectors ranging from nuclear, up to energy and manufacturing. Currently, PLC vulnerability assessment practices employed by ICS operators are limited due to their reliance on empirical observations of visible code crashes prompted by PLC compilers. In parallel, the prevalent PLC firmware dependency on proprietary vendor routines restricts the composition of generic vulnerability detection or discovery schemes for zero-day threat vectors. In this work, we propose Sizzler: a novel vendor-independent vulnerability discovery framework specific to PLC applications operating with logic realised through ladder diagrams. Sizzler extends the current state of the art by proposing the optimal synergy of a mutation-based fuzzing strategy using Sequential Generative Adversarial Network (SeqGAN). By virtue of critical vendor restrictions on emulating PLC firmware, we also refine the Quick Emulator (QEMU)\\u2019s General Purpose I/O (GPIO) and the Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) protocols to evaluate and compare Sizzler across 30 PLC ladder diagram programs compiled from LDmicro and OpenPLC projects over five widely used Micro-Controller Units (MCUs). It is noteworthy that Sizzler has successfully identified vulnerabilities in ladder diagrams within a relatively short time frame based on our proprietary dataset and secured a CVE-ID. Moreover, through a comparison of Sizzler with prevalent fuzzing techniques over the commonly used Magma and LAVA-M datasets we exhibit its wider applicability on embedded systems and identify its limitations.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Background With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, prediction of warfarin dose via machine learning has received more and more attention. Since the dose prediction involve both linear and nonlinear problems, traditional machine learning algorithms are ineffective to solve such problems at one time. Objective Based on the characteristics of clinical data of Chinese warfarin patients, an improved stacking ensemble learning can achieve higher prediction accuracy. Methods Information of 641 patients from southern China who had reached a steady state on warfarin was collected, including demographic information, medical history, genotype, and co-medication status. The dataset was randomly divided into a training set (90%) and a test set (10%). The predictive capability is evaluated on a new test set generated by stacking ensemble learning. Additional factors associated with warfarin dose were discovered by feature selection methods. Results A newly proposed heuristic-stacking ensemble learning performs better than traditional-stacking ensemble learning in key metrics such as accuracy of ideal dose (73.44%, 71.88%), mean absolute errors (0.11 mg/day, 0.13 mg/day), root mean square errors (0.18 mg/day, 0.20 mg/day) and R2 (0.87, 0.82). Conclusions The developed heuristic-stacking ensemble learning can satisfactorily predict warfarin dose with high accuracy. A relationship between hypertension, a history of severe preoperative embolism, and warfarin dose is found, which provides a useful reference for the warfarin dose administration in the future.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Unlike primates, training artificial neural networks on changing data distributions leads to a rapid decrease in performance on old tasks. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we investigate the representational changes that underlie this performance decrease and identify three distinct processes that together account for the phenomenon. The largest component is a misalignment between hidden representations and readout layers. Misalignment occurs due to learning on additional tasks and causes internal representations to shift. Representational geometry is partially conserved under this misalignment and only a small part of the information is irrecoverably lost. All types of representational changes scale with the dimensionality of hidden representations. These insights have implications for deep learning applications that need to be continuously updated, but may also aid aligning ANN models to the rather robust biological vision.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Particle image velocimetry (PIV) is a widely used experimental technique in ocean engineering, for instance, to study the vortex fields near marine risers and the wake fields behind wind turbines or ship propellers. However, the flow fields measured using PIV in water tanks or wind tunnels always have low resolution; hence, it is difficult to accurately reveal the mechanics behind the complex phenomena sometimes observed. In this paper, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), which introduce the Navier\\u2013Stokes equations or the continuity equation into the loss function during training to reconstruct a flow field with high resolution, are investigated. The accuracy is compared with the cubic spline interpolation method and a classic neural network in a case study of reconstructing a two-dimensional flow field around a cylinder, which is obtained through direct numerical simulation. Finally, the validated PINN method is applied to reconstruct a flow field measured using PIV and shows good performance.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"ABsTRACT. The rapid surge in social media usage has augmented the significance and value of data available on these platforms. As a result, analyzing community sentiment and opinions related to various topics and events using social media data has become increasingly crucial. However, the sheer volume of data produced on social media platforms surpasses human processing capabilities. Consequently, artificial intelligence-based models became frequently employed in social media analysis. In this study, deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) methods are applied to assess user opinions regarding airlines, and the effectiveness of these methods in social media analysis is comparatively discussed based on the performance results obtained. Due to the imbalanced nature of the dataset, synthetic data is produced using the Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE) to enhance model performance. Before the SMOTE process, the dataset containing 14640 data points expanded to 27534 data points after the SMOTE process. The experimental results demonstrate that Support Vector Machines (SVM) achieved the highest performance among all methods with accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score values of 0.79 in the pre-SMOTE (imbalanced dataset). In contrast, Random Forest (RF) obtained the best performance among all methods, with accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score values of 0.88 in the post-SMOTE (balanced data set). Moreover, experimental findings demonstrate that SMOTE led to performance improvements in ML and DL models, ranging from a minimum of 3% to a maximum of 24% increase in F-Score metric.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"This paper presents a learnable solver tailored to solve discretized linear partial differential equations (PDEs). This solver requires only problem-specific training data, without using specialized expertise. Its development is anchored by three core principles: (1) a multilevel hierarchy to promote rapid convergence, (2) adherence to linearity concerning the right-hand side of equations, and (3) weights sharing across different levels to facilitate adaptability to various problem sizes. Built on these foundational principles, we introduce a network adept at solving PDEs discretized on structured grids, even when faced with heterogeneous coefficients. The cornerstone of our proposed solver is the convolutional neural network (CNN), chosen for its capacity to learn from structured data and its similar computation pattern as multigrid components. To evaluate its effectiveness, the solver was trained to solve convection-diffusion equations featuring heterogeneous diffusion coefficients. The solver exhibited swift convergence to high accuracy over a range of grid sizes, extending from $31 \\\\times 31$ to $4095 \\\\times 4095$. Remarkably, our method outperformed the classical Geometric Multigrid (GMG) solver, demonstrating a speedup of approximately 3 to 8 times. Furthermore, we explored the solver's generalizability to untrained coefficient distributions. The findings showed consistent reliability across various other coefficient distributions, revealing that when trained on a mixed coefficient distribution, the solver is nearly as effective in generalizing to all types of coefficient distributions.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Infrared small target detection (ISTD) has been widely concerned in certain fields like astronomy, surveillance, and missile early warning system. ISTD is still a challenging task due to the complex backgrounds and small size of targets, which restrict the performance of the convolutional neural networks (CNN) in ISTD. To this end, a dual branch architecture which combines nested attention network and auxiliary transformer enhancement (NANetFormer) is proposed. The CNN-based branch uses channel-spatial-attention embedded U-Net++ architecture to obtain low-level local details of small targets and suppress background noises. The transformer-based branch applies hierarchical self-attention mechanism as an auxiliary enhancement encoder path. Furthermore, we design a local-global feature fusion module to make feature concentration of two branches. Experimental results show that proposed network achieves competitive results compared with other state-of-the-art methods.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"In children, objective, quantitative tools that determine functional neurodevelopment are scarce and rarely scalable for clinical use. Direct recordings of cortical activity using routinely acquired electroencephalography (EEG) offer physiologically reliable measures of brain function. Here, we develop a novel measure of functional brain age (FBA) using a residual neural network based interpretation of the pediatric EEG. We show that the FBA from a 10 to 15 minute segment of 18-channel EEG during light sleep (stages 1 and 2) in typically developing children and adolescents was strongly associated with chronological age (R2 = 0.96, 95%CI: 0.94 - 0.96, n = 1062, age range: 1 month to 18 years). The mean absolute error (MAE) between FBA and age was 0.6 years (n = 1062), with an MAE of 2.1 years following validation on an independent set of EEG recordings (n = 723). The FBA detected group level maturational delays in a small cohort of children with abnormal neurodevelopment (p = 0.00053, n = 40). Our work offers a practical, scalable and powerful automated tool for tracking maturation of brain function throughout childhood with an accuracy comparable to that of widely used physical growth charts.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Non-linear activation function plays an essential role in neural networks (NNs) for their generalization ability. However, deploying the intricate mathematical operations on hardware platforms like Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) turns out a great challenge. Prior works based on piecewise functions or look-up table (LUT) either involve complex manual operations or neglect hardware overhead. To this end, this paper proposes a simple yet scalable and effective approximation called DIF-LUT, which is applicable to various non-linear functions. Specifically, the proposed method can achieve accurate approximation by piecewise linear matching to fit the function derivative roughly and range addressable LUT to offset the difference. Moreover, self-adaptive mechanisms are applied to automatically minimize hardware cost in terms of different accuracies. The experiments show that compared to state-of-the-art methods, DIF-LUT costs 43.68% fewer LUTs and 70.8% fewer flip-flops (FFs) without any digital signal processor (DSP), while achieving 2.7x approximation accuracy at 554.1MHz on Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Multiscale FE2 computations enable the consideration of the micro-mechanical material structure in macroscopical simulations. However, these computations are very time-consuming because of numerous evaluations of a representative volume element, which represents the microstructure. In contrast, neural networks as machine learning methods are very fast to evaluate once they are trained. Even the DNN-FE2 approach is currently a known procedure, where deep neural networks (DNNs) are applied as a surrogate model of the representative volume element. In this contribution, however, a clear description of the algorithmic FE2 structure and the particular integration of deep neural networks are explained in detail. This comprises a suitable training strategy, where particular knowledge of the material behavior is considered to reduce the required amount of training data, a study of the amount of training data required for reliable FE2 simulations with special focus on the errors compared to conventional FE2 simulations, and the implementation aspect to gain considerable speed-up. As it is known, the Sobolev training and automatic differentiation increase data efficiency, prediction accuracy and speed-up in comparison to using two different neural networks for stress and tangent matrix prediction. To gain a significant speed-up of the FE2 computations, an efficient implementation of the trained neural network in a finite element code is provided. This is achieved by drawing on state-of-the-art high-performance computing libraries and just-in-time compilation yielding a maximum speed-up of a factor of more than 5000 compared to a reference FE2 computation. Moreover, the deep neural network surrogate model is able to overcome load-step size limitations of the RVE computations in step-size controlled computations.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Purpose: to determine the effectiveness of using modern computer vision technologies to determine the body parts of wrestlers in competitive activities. Material and methods. The following methods were used in the research: analysis of scientific and methodical literature and Internet sources, analysis of video and images with the help of computer vision (Computer Vision, Machine Learning), methods of mathematical statistics. The final bout in the 65 kg weight category at the 2021 Tokyo Olympics in freestyle wrestling was chosen for analysis. The total number of video fragments was 1763 images. The Yolo machine learning model was used to detect faces, and Google's MediaPipe model was used to detect body parts. For each athlete, 21 body parts were identified. Results: the accuracy of identifying athletes' body parts was obtained: all indicators were above 78 %. The results of the analysis showed that the lower limbs are better identified: hip, knee, ankle, etc. The identification accuracy is above 90%. At the same time, the identification accuracy of the upper limbs is lower. In our opinion, this is due to the fact that athletes spend a sufficient amount of time in the grip and preparing for an attack during the fight. During this time, certain parts of the upper limbs are closed for identification. Analysis of the results of the number of unidentified images showed a similar trend to the identification accuracy. Most of the unidentified body parts were associated with the upper limbs (more than 25 %). At the same time, 10 to 12 % of the body parts associated with the delicate limbs were not identified. Conclusions. The analysis of results of the use of modern technologies of computer vision for determination of links of a body of wrestlers in competitive activity is carried out. The algorithm for studying the body parts of athletes had two stages: the first stage is to determine the area of the image fragment (video) where the athletes are located and the second is to determine the body parts of each wrestler. At the first stage of the study, it was possible to identify both athletes in 79,5 % of the images. The analysis of the accuracy of the athletes' body parts identification showed that the body parts of the lower limbs are better identified than those of te right limbs. This is due to the peculiarity of competitive activity. The visual analysis of the images showed that a certain part of the identified links do not coincide with the actual location of the athletes' body links.\",\n",

Using the transcriptome data of gastric cancer in our study, relevant proteins of mTOR signaling pathway were screened to identify key genes by four machine learning models, and the models were validated in external datasets. Through correlation analysis, we explored the relationship between five key genes and immune cells and immunotherapy. By inducing cellular senescence in gastric cancer cells with bleomycin, we investigated changes in the expression levels of HRAS through western blot. By PCA clustering analysis, we used the five key genes for gastric cancer typing and explored differences in drug sensitivity and enrichment pathways between different clustering groups. We found that the SVM machine learning model was superior, and the five genes (PPARA, FNIP1, WNT5A, HRAS, HIF1A) were highly correlated with different immune cells in multiple databases. These five key genes have a significant impact on immunotherapy. Using the five genes for gastric cancer gene typing, four genes were expressed higher in group 1 and were more sensitive to drugs in group 2. These results suggest that subtype-specific markers can improve the treatment and provide precision drugs for gastric cancer patients.\",\n",

Diagnosis of this disease is quite difficult because the symptoms are similar to other diseases. Currently, diagnosis can be done using machine learning by utilizing patient voice recordings. The features generated from the extraction of voice recordings are relatively large, so feature selection needs to be done to avoid deteriorating the performance of a model. In this research, Particle Swarm Optimization is used as feature selection, while XGBoost will be used as a classification model. In addition, the model will also be applied SMOTE to overcome the problem of data class imbalance and hyperparameter tuning on XGBoost to get optimal hyperparameters. The test results show that the AUC value on the model with feature selection without SMOTE and hyperparameter tuning is 0.9325, while the model without feature selection only gets an AUC value of 0.9250. However, when both SMOTE and hyperparameter tuning techniques are used together, the use of feature selection is able to provide improved performance on the model. The model with feature selection gets an AUC value of 0.9483, while the model without feature selection only gets an AUC value of 0.9366.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The exponential moving average (EMA) is a commonly used statistic for providing stable estimates of stochastic quantities in deep learning optimization. Recently, EMA has seen considerable use in generative models, where it is computed with respect to the model weights, and significantly improves the stability of the inference model during and after training. While the practice of weight averaging at the end of training is well-studied and known to improve estimates of local optima, the benefits of EMA over the course of training is less understood. In this paper, we derive an explicit connection between EMA and a damped harmonic system between two particles, where one particle (the EMA weights) is drawn to the other (the model weights) via an idealized zero-length spring. We then leverage this physical analogy to analyze the effectiveness of EMA, and propose an improved training algorithm, which we call BELAY. Finally, we demonstrate theoretically and empirically several advantages enjoyed by BELAY over standard EMA.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Large language models (LLMs) are central to modern natural language processing, delivering exceptional performance in various tasks. However, their substantial computational and memory requirements present challenges, especially for devices with limited DRAM capacity. This paper tackles the challenge of efficiently running LLMs that exceed the available DRAM capacity by storing the model parameters in flash memory, but bringing them on demand to DRAM. Our method involves constructing an inference cost model that takes into account the characteristics of flash memory, guiding us to optimize in two critical areas: reducing the volume of data transferred from flash and reading data in larger, more contiguous chunks. Within this hardware-informed framework, we introduce two principal techniques. First,\\\"windowing\\\"strategically reduces data transfer by reusing previously activated neurons, and second,\\\"row-column bundling\\\", tailored to the sequential data access strengths of flash memory, increases the size of data chunks read from flash memory. These methods collectively enable running models up to twice the size of the available DRAM, with a 4-5x and 20-25x increase in inference speed compared to naive loading approaches in CPU and GPU, respectively. Our integration of sparsity awareness, context-adaptive loading, and a hardware-oriented design paves the way for effective inference of LLMs on devices with limited memory.\",\n",

Several dataset-pruning metrics have been proposed to increase the training efficiency of these models. However, these metrics require example labels and an initial training step to compute example scores which is computationally intensive. We propose a novel self-supervised pruning metric for efficient dataset pruning in neural anti-spoofing models. Our method identifies important examples and prunes the dataset in an efficient, self-supervised manner using the clustered embedding representation of audios. We demonstrate that our method exceeds the performance of four other pruning metrics on the ASVSpoof 2019 dataset across two anti-spoofing models while being 91% computationally more efficient. We also find differences in the distribution of certain attacks, which helps explain the better performance of self-supervised pruning over other metrics.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Objective: This paper aims to address the challenges in citation screening (a.k.a. abstract screening) within Systematic Reviews (SR) by leveraging the zero-shot capabilities of large language models, particularly ChatGPT. Methods: We employ ChatGPT as a zero-shot ranker to prioritize candidate studies by aligning abstracts with the selection criteria outlined in an SR protocol. Citation screening was transformed into a novel question-answering (QA) framework, treating each selection criterion as a question addressed by ChatGPT. The framework involves breaking down the selection criteria into multiple questions, properly prompting ChatGPT to answer each question, scoring and re-ranking each answer, and combining the responses to make nuanced inclusion or exclusion decisions. Results: Large-scale validation was performed on the benchmark of CLEF eHealth 2019 Task 2: Technology Assisted Reviews in Empirical Medicine. Across 31 datasets of four categories of SRs, the proposed QA framework consistently outperformed other zero-shot ranking models. Compared with complex ranking approaches with iterative relevance feedback and fine-tuned deep learning-based ranking models, our ChatGPT-based zero-shot citation screening approaches still demonstrated competitive and sometimes better results, underscoring their high potential in facilitating automated systematic reviews. Conclusion: Investigation justified the indispensable value of leveraging selection criteria to improve the performance of automated citation screening. ChatGPT demonstrated proficiency in prioritizing candidate studies for citation screening using the proposed QA framework. Significant performance improvements were obtained by re-ranking answers using the semantic alignment between abstracts and selection criteria. This further highlighted the pertinence of utilizing selection criteria to enhance citation screening.\",\n",

Our mobile application provides an early warning system through the flood risk map that is accessible to users. Our dataset comprises 37 regions in Tamil Nadu, which are the meteorological stations and also the base stations of dams. The latter allows for notification in the event of flood and dam overflow respectively. Furthermore, our mobile app enables users to easily identify camps and shelters established during flood periods and even add information about them. In addition, our mobile app also provides users with the necessary helpline numbers to reach out for assistance during flood times.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Parkinson's disease (PD) diagnosis based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is still challenging clinically. Quantitative susceptibility maps (QSM) can potentially provide underlying pathophysiological information by detecting the iron distribution in deep gray matter (DGM) nuclei. We hypothesized that deep learning (DL) could be used to automatically segment all DGM nuclei and use relevant features for a better differentiation between PD and healthy controls (HC). In this study, we proposed a DL\\u2010based pipeline for automatic PD diagnosis based on QSM and T1\\u2010weighted (T1W) images. This consists of (1) a convolutional neural network model integrated with multiple attention mechanisms which simultaneously segments caudate nucleus, globus pallidus, putamen, red nucleus, and substantia nigra from QSM and T1W images, and (2) an SE\\u2010ResNeXt50 model with an anatomical attention mechanism, which uses QSM data and the segmented nuclei to distinguish PD from HC. The mean dice values for segmentation of the five DGM nuclei are all >0.83 in the internal testing cohort, suggesting that the model could segment brain nuclei accurately. The proposed PD diagnosis model achieved area under the the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) of 0.901 and 0.845 on independent internal and external testing cohorts, respectively. Gradient\\u2010weighted class activation mapping (Grad\\u2010CAM) heatmaps were used to identify contributing nuclei for PD diagnosis on patient level. In conclusion, the proposed approach can potentially be used as an automatic, explainable pipeline for PD diagnosis in a clinical setting.\",\n",

In this work, we propose a lightweight image captioning network in combination with continuous diffusion, called Prefix-diffusion. To achieve diversity, we design an efficient method that injects prefix image embeddings into the denoising process of the diffusion model. In order to reduce trainable parameters, we employ a pre-trained model to extract image features and further design an extra mapping network. Prefix-diffusion is able to generate diverse captions with relatively less parameters, while maintaining the fluency and relevance of the captions benefiting from the generative capabilities of the diffusion model. Our work paves the way for scaling up diffusion models for image captioning, and achieves promising performance compared with recent approaches.\",\n",

In order to classify each character, we present Convolutional Neural Networks and Transfer Learning techniques.

Initially we pre-process each image of character to remove noise, convert to gray-scale, applied gaussian blur and canny edge detection and cropped the images and at last resizing it. These methods help in training neural networks to recognize the characters with good accuracy. Then we apply transfer learning to same dataset, here we resize image into three-dimensional and convert images into gray-scale and using xception we train the model. Even though a few of the kannada language\\u2019s characters have similarities, this model can accurately categorise each character to the appropriate class and identify it with better accuracy than CNN.\",\n",

This research aims at reviewing related work and presenting a case study to investigate the robustness of a fine-tuned version of Face Transformer under different pose, age, and gender variations for several degradations such as noise, blur, and resolution reduction. Several experiments have been conducted to train and test the model using two benchmark datasets (VGGFace2 and LFW) and benchmark its performance with FaceNet.\",\n",

Common touch surfaces such as elevator switches and ATM switches are hazardous to touch as they are used by countless people every day, increasing the chance of getting infected. So, a need for touch-less interaction with machines arises. In this paper, we propose a method of recognizing the ten decimal digits (0-9) by writing the digits in the air near a sensing printed circuit board using a human hand. We captured the movement of the hand by a sensor based on projective capacitance and classified it into digits using an Artificial Neural Network. Our method does not use pictures, which significantly reduces the computational requirements and preserves users' privacy. Thus, the proposed method can be easily implemented in public places.\",\n",

In response to this challenge, we propose HPC-GPT, a novel LLaMA-based model that has been supervised fine-tuning using generated QA (Question-Answer) instances for the HPC domain. To evaluate its effectiveness, we concentrate on two HPC tasks: managing AI models and datasets for HPC, and data race detection.

Our experiments on open-source benchmarks yield extensive results, underscoring HPC-GPT\\u2019s potential to bridge the performance gap between LLMs and HPC-specific tasks.

      "      \"abstract\": \"Inevitable defects have an important impact on the fatigue lifetime of additive manufacturing materials. Therefore, it is critical to thoroughly characterize the characteristics of the defects, which requires effective semantic segmentation of the imaged defects. In this paper, a defect dataset for SLM Ti-6Al-4V alloy was obtained by synchrotron radiation computed tomography. Then a semantic segmentation method was developed based on the DeepLabV3\\u2009+\\u2009network to automatically extract defects. Cropping and undersampling were introduced in the dataset pre-processing. A weighted scheme based on the ratio between the number of defect and matrix pixels was applied in the classification layer, and morphological operations were employed in image post-processing to improve the accuracy of identifying small-target defect. Finally, the above method was applied to segment the X-ray computed tomography data for two batches of SLM Ti-6Al-4V materials, and the defect segmentation results were used to predict the fatigue lifetime. The semantic segmentation method performs well with a pixel recognition accuracy of 98.2% for the test dataset, and the error in the predicted fatigue lifetime lies within the scatter band of \\u00b12.2.

      "      \"abstract\": \"Human pose estimation is an important Computer Vision problem, whose goal is to estimate the human body through joints. Currently, methods that employ deep learning techniques excel in the task of 2D human pose estimation. However, the use of 3D poses can bring more accurate and robust results. Since 3D pose labels can only be acquired in restricted scenarios, fully convolutional methods tend to perform poorly on the task. One strategy to solve this problem is to use 2D pose estimators, to estimate 3D poses in two steps using 2D pose inputs. Due to database acquisition constraints, the performance improvement of this strategy can only be observed in controlled environments, therefore domain adaptation techniques can be used to increase the generalization capability of the system by inserting information from synthetic domains. In this work, we propose a novel method called Domain Unified approach, aimed at solving pose misalignment problems on a cross-dataset scenario, through a combination of three modules on top of the pose estimator: pose converter, uncertainty estimator, and domain classifier. Our method led to a 44.1mm (29.24%) error reduction, when training with the SURREAL synthetic dataset and evaluating with Human3.6M over a no-adaption scenario, achieving state-of-the-art performance.\",\n",

Recently, there has been a rise in the number of researchers that are keen on evaluating and forecasting the air quality in close proximity to individuals. The use of the Internet of Things (IoT) across several businesses has significantly enhanced people's quality of life by interconnecting multiple sensors in diverse locations. Moreover, the Internet of Things (IoT) has streamlined the task of monitoring air pollution. The conventional utilization of stationary sensors is inadequate for acquiring an accurate and all-encompassing representation of the air pollution levels in close proximity to people. This is due to the fact that the sensors in closest proximity to people may be located many kilometers apart from each other. The objective of our study is to construct a model that precisely depicts the air quality pattern within a certain geographic area. This objective will be accomplished by using a combination of stationary and portable Internet of Things sensors. The sensors are affixed to vehicles that are carrying out surveillance in the vicinity. Our methodology allows for a thorough examination of the whole spectrum of air quality fluctuations in neighboring regions. Through the use of many machine learning algorithms and realworld data, we showcase the efficacy of our methodology in accurately discerning and forecasting air quality without compromising on accuracy. The results of our research indicate that there is significant potential for efficiently monitoring and forecasting air quality in the context of a smart city.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Power system load forecasting is a method that uses historical load data to predict electricity load data for a future time period. Aiming at the problems of general prediction accuracy and slow prediction speed in using typical machine learning methods, an improved fuzzy support vector regression machine method is proposed for power load forecasting. In this method, the boundary vector extraction technique is employed in the design of the membership function for fuzzy support vectors to differentiate the importance of different samples in the regression process. This method utilizes a membership function based on boundary vectors to assign differential weights to different sample points that used to differentiate the importance of different types of samples in the regression analysis process in order to improve the accuracy of electricity load prediction. The key parameters of the fuzzy support vector regression model are optimized, further enhancing the precision of the forecasting results. Simulation experiments are conducted using real power load data sets, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of accuracy and speed in predicting power load data compared to other prediction models. This method can be widely applied in real power production and scheduling processes.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Background Individualising mental healthcare at times when a patient is most at risk of suicide involves shifting research emphasis from static risk factors to those that may be modifiable with interventions. Currently, risk assessment is based on a range of extensively reported stable risk factors, but critical to dynamic suicide risk assessment is an understanding of each individual patient\\u2019s health trajectory over time. The use of electronic health records (EHRs) and analysis using machine learning has the potential to accelerate progress in developing early warning indicators. Setting EHR data from the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (SLaM) which provides secondary mental healthcare for 1.8 million people living in four South London boroughs. Objectives To determine whether the time window proximal to a hospitalised suicide attempt can be discriminated from a distal period of lower risk by analysing the documentation and mental health clinical free text data from EHRs and (i) investigate whether the rate at which EHR documents are recorded per patient is associated with a suicide attempt; (ii) compare document-level word usage between documents proximal and distal to a suicide attempt; and (iii) compare n-gram frequency related to third-person pronoun use proximal and distal to a suicide attempt using machine learning. Methods The Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) system allowed access to de-identified information from the EHRs. CRIS has been linked with Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data for Admitted Patient Care. We analysed document and event data for patients who had at some point between 1 April 2006 and 31 March 2013 been hospitalised with a HES ICD-10 code related to attempted suicide (X60\\u2013X84; Y10\\u2013Y34; Y87.0/Y87.2). Findings n\\u2009=\\u20098,247 patients were identified to have made a hospitalised suicide attempt. Of these, n\\u2009=\\u20093,167 (39.8%) of patients had at least one document available in their EHR prior to their first suicide attempt. N\\u2009=\\u20091,424 (45.0%) of these patients had been \\u201cmonitored\\u201d by mental healthcare services in the past 30\\u2009days. From 60\\u2009days prior to a first suicide attempt, there was a rapid increase in the monitoring level (document recording of the past 30\\u2009days) increasing from 35.1 to 45.0%. Documents containing words related to prescribed medications/drugs/overdose/poisoning/addiction had the highest odds of being a risk indicator used proximal to a suicide attempt (OR 1.88; precision 0.91 and recall 0.93), and documents with words citing a care plan were associated with the lowest risk for a suicide attempt (OR 0.22; precision 1.00 and recall 1.00). Function words, word sequence, and pronouns were most common in all three representations (uni-, bi-, and tri-gram). Conclusion EHR documentation frequency and language use can be used to distinguish periods distal from and proximal to a suicide attempt. However, in our study 55.0% of patients with documentation, prior to their first suicide attempt, did not have a record in the preceding 30\\u2009days, meaning that there are a high number who are not seen by services at their most vulnerable point.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Generative tasks, such as text generation and question answering, hold a crucial position in the realm of mobile applications. Due to their sensitivity to privacy concerns, there is a growing demand for their execution directly on mobile devices. Currently, the execution of these generative tasks heavily depends on Large Language Models (LLMs). Nevertheless, the limited memory capacity of these devices presents a formidable challenge to the scalability of such models. In our research, we introduce LLMCad, an innovative on-device inference engine specifically designed for efficient generative Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. The core idea behind LLMCad revolves around model collaboration: a compact LLM, residing in memory, takes charge of generating the most straightforward tokens, while a high-precision LLM steps in to validate these tokens and rectify any identified errors. LLMCad incorporates three novel techniques: (1) Instead of generating candidate tokens in a sequential manner, LLMCad employs the smaller LLM to construct a token tree, encompassing a wider range of plausible token pathways. Subsequently, the larger LLM can efficiently validate all of these pathways simultaneously. (2) It employs a self-adjusting fallback strategy, swiftly initiating the verification process whenever the smaller LLM generates an erroneous token. (3) To ensure a continuous flow of token generation, LLMCad speculatively generates tokens during the verification process by implementing a compute-IO pipeline. Through an extensive series of experiments, LLMCad showcases an impressive token generation speed, achieving rates up to 9.3x faster than existing inference engines.\",\n",

Differences in gut bacteria that are associated with the occurrence and development of colorectal cancer (CRC) exist between sexes, and males have a higher morbidity of CRC.Gap Statement. Clinical data for the relationship between gut bacteria and sexes in patients with CRC are not available and are needed to support individualized screening and treatment programmes.Aim. To analyse the relationship between gut bacteria and sexes in patients with CRC.Methodology. A total of 6\\u2009077\\u2009samples recruited by Fudan University's Academy of Brain Artificial Intelligence Science and Technology were included, and the gut bacteria composition mainly shows the top 30 genera. Linear discriminant analysis Effect Size (LEfSe) was used to analyse the differences in gut bacteria. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to demonstrate the relationship of discrepant bacteria. CRC risk prediction models were used to rank the importance of valid discrepant bacteria.Results. Bacteroides, Eubacterium and Faecalibacterium were the top three bacteria in males with CRC, while Bacteroides, Subdoligranulum and Eubacterium were the top three bacteria in females with CRC. The abundance of gut bacteria (Escherichia, Eubacteriales, Clostridia, etc.) was higher in males with CRC compared with that in females with CRC. In addition, Dorea and Bacteroides were important CRC-related bacteria (P<0.001). Finally, the importance of discrepant bacteria was ranked based on CRC risk prediction models. Blautia, Barnesiella and Anaerostipes were the top three important discrepant bacteria between males with CRC and females with CRC. The value of AUC was 1.0, the sensitivity was 92.0\\u200a%, the specificity was 68.4\\u200a%, and the accuracy was 83.3\\u200a% in the discovery set.Conclusion. Gut bacteria were correlated with sexes and CRC. It is necessary to consider gender when gut bacteria are used to treat and predict CRC.\",\n",

To tackle this challenge, we introduce the U-shaped Vision Mamba (UVM-Net), an efficient single-image dehazing network. Inspired by the State Space Sequence Models (SSMs), a new deep sequence model known for its power to handle long sequences, we design a Bi-SSM block that integrates the local feature extraction ability of the convolutional layer with the ability of the SSM to capture long-range dependencies. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our method provides a more highly efficient idea of long-range dependency modeling for image dehazing as well as other image restoration tasks. The URL of the code is \\\\url{https://github.com/zzr-idam/UVM-Net}. Our method takes only \\\\textbf{0.009} seconds to infer a $325 \\\\times 325$ resolution image (100FPS) without I/O handling time.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Graph neural networks (GNNs) are becoming increasingly popular for multi-agent autonomy applications. For mission planning, when numerous autonomous agents are involved, even simple behaviors can overwhelm the human commander. This is because the number of possible interactions between agents and possible outcomes for coordinating effective teaming grows exponentially. Artificial intelligence can be used to learn effective agent behaviors to create what we define as a Virtual Commander (VC). The VC can be used to learn friendly and/or adversary behaviors in a complex mission planning scenario. A VC may be comprised of multiple machine learning components, such as behavior classification and behavior prediction. Based on classifying a particular behavior mode at any instant in time, future behaviors can be learned and therefore predicted to aid a commander in effective mission planning. In this work we compare 2 methods of behavior mode classification for a virtual commander using graphs. The first method uses an image-based digit (IBD) classifier for mode classification, while the second method uses adjacency matrix-based (AMB) classifier to perform mode classification. Though both classifiers predict the VC mode classification correctly <90% of the time, we show that the AMB performs better than IBD, while also reducing the data generation complexity for training and testing by multiple orders of magnitude.\",\n",

Approximately 1,3 million people lose their lives daily due to traffic accidents [World Health Organization, 2022]. Addressing this issue requires accurate traffic law violation detection systems to ensure adherence to regulations. The integration of Artificial Intelligence algorithms, leveraging machine learning and computer vision, has facilitated the development of precise traffic rule enforcement. This paper illustrates how computer vision and machine learning enable the creation of robust algorithms for detecting various traffic violations. Our model, capable of identifying six common traffic infractions, detects red light violations, illegal use of breakdown lanes, violations of vehicle following distance, breaches of marked crosswalk laws, illegal parking, and parking on marked crosswalks. Utilizing online traffic footage and a self-mounted on-dash camera, we apply the YOLOv5 algorithm's detection module to identify traffic agents such as cars, pedestrians, and traffic signs, and the strongSORT algorithm for continuous interframe tracking. Six discrete algorithms analyze agents' behavior and trajectory to detect violations. Subsequently, an Identification Module extracts vehicle ID information, such as the license plate, to generate violation notices sent to relevant authorities.\",\n",

The satellite positioning system is one of the most widely used positioning technologies, but in the indoor environment, satellite signals are easily hindered by buildings, GPS positioning error is large, then it is necessary to use other technologies to achieve indoor positioning. For indoor positioning technology, there have been a lot of research results, such as Bluetooth, ultra-wideband, geomagnetic, Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity), Zigbee, and PDR (Pedestrian Dead Reckoning) technology. Wi-Fi devices are very popular in many indoor environments today, because most mobile devices can receive Wi-Fi signals, and Wi-Fi Access points (AP) is widely deployed indoors and has the advantages of low cost and easy access to signals. The indoor positioning technology based on Wi-Fi signals has become a hot topic in indoor positioning research. Wi-Fi positioning technology based on location fingerprint is the most widely used Wi-Fi indoor positioning technology. However, due to the complex and changeable indoor environment, signal propagation is affected by many obstacles, which leads to the low positioning accuracy of Wi-Fi-based fingerprint positioning technology. Aiming at Wi-Fi location fingerprint indoor positioning technology requirements, this paper proposes an indoor positioning method based on LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), which uses the time domain information in the positioning process to improve positioning accuracy. The network consists of a fully connected layer and an LSTM layer, whose input is a time series of RSSI, and the output is an estimate of the position at the last moment in the input sequence. However, using only this method may produce some phenomena such as unbalanced prediction, and fall into local optimal solutions. Due to the existence of the above problems, GA (Genetic Algorithm) is used in the hyperparameter optimization of the LSTM model in this paper. The genetic algorithm takes the maximization of the fitness value as the goal and continuously iterates the population to find the optimal time window width and the optimal hidden layer neural unit. The optimized parameters are substituted into the long short-term memory neural network model, and the conclusion that the LSTM model optimized by the genetic algorithm is more accurate than the LSTM model is obtained. DNN, CNN and other models are also used for comparison, which shows that the prediction effect of the LSTM model is better than that of tother models.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"In an age where computing capabilities are expanding at a breathtaking pace, the advent of Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) technology presents unprecedented opportunities and challenges to the future of design. It is crucial for designers to investigate how to utilize this powerful tool to facilitate innovation effectively. As AIGC technology evolves, it will inevitably shift the expectations of designers, compelling them to delve deeper into the essence of design creativity, transcending traditional sketching or modeling skills. This study provides valuable insights for designers on leveraging AIGC for forward-thinking design innovation. We focus on the representative AIGC tool, \\u201cMidjourney\\u201d, to explore its integration into design systems for collaborative innovation among content creators. We introduce an AIGC-based Midjourney path for product design and present a supporting tool card set: AMP-Cards. To confirm their utility, we undertook extensive validation through advanced prototype design research, task-specific project practices, and interdisciplinary collaborative seminars. Our findings indicate that AIGC can considerably enhance designers\\u2019 efficiency during product development, especially in the \\u201cexplorative product shape\\u201d phase. The technology excels in identifying design styles and quickly producing varied design solutions. Moreover, AIGC\\u2019s capacity to swiftly translate creators\\u2019 concepts into visual forms greatly aids in multidisciplinary team communication and innovation.\",\n",

To address the challenge of identifying tailspike proteins due to their sequence diversity, we developed SpikeHunter, an approach based on the ESM-2 protein language model. Using SpikeHunter, we successfully identified 231,965 tailspike proteins from a dataset comprising 8,434,494 prophages found within 165,365 genomes of five common pathogens. Among these proteins, 143,035 tailspike proteins displayed strong associations with serotypes. Moreover, we observed highly similar tailspike proteins in species that share closely related serotypes. We found extensive domain swapping in all five species, with the C-terminal domain being significantly associated with host serotype highlighting its role in host range determination. Our study presents a comprehensive cross-species analysis of tailspike protein to serotype associations, providing insights applicable to phage therapy and biotechnology.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The database used by blockchain innovation is run by numerous components and creates a network pattern using hash indexes. The blockchain employs numerous nodes and transmits numerous data access points, decreasing reliance on the primary Internet server and preventing the danger of data destruction and server breakdown. The data files saved in the blockchain are protected using encryption techniques to maintain their authenticity and prevent illegally added or discarded data files. With technological characteristics like non-tampering, distributed ledger, and reliability, blockchain innovations and machine learning have innate benefits in supply chain finance. They also have great prospects to construct faith in order to overcome the major issues in supply chain finance, which is helpful for fostering economic advancement in the Tonkin Gulf region. This paper focuses on introducing the study on using blockchain innovation in supply chain finance in the Tonkin Gulf region and aims to offer suggestions on how supply chain finance could evolve there using blockchain innovation. This paper suggests supply chain finance game applications for pertinent investigations as well as blockchain innovation, supply chain banking threats assessment on the blockchain and machine learning, and supply chain finance implementation study methodologies in the Tonkin Gulf region. The empirical findings presented in this paper demonstrate that the built blockchain supply chain finance platform has an algorithm with an overall processing time of 4.10 seconds, a computational efficiency that is quicker, and the ability to more accurately analyse the pertinent concerns.\",\n",

Previous work shows that neurons in the hippocampus fire in sequence to encode spatial information. The same group of cells will replay in memory consolidation, coupled with ripples, spindle, and slow waves. As for episodic memory, engram cells have been proposed to explain the encoding and transformation of episodic memory. Another universe theory about memory is the cognitive map theory. Here I use cognitive map theory as the bridge to overcome the gap between spatial and episodic memory. I believe spatial memory is a highly compressed case of episodic memory. In addition, I propose the hypothesis that engram can trigger sharp-wave ripples. I use a spike neural network-based computational model to verify this hypothesis. In conclusion, I believe engram cells and sharp-wave ripples are two different phenomena under a unified memory system.\",\n",

In this paper, we developed a hyperspectral imaging (HSI) endoscopy imaging system that can diagnose breast cancer tissue samples to improve operating room efficiency and patients' clinical experience. Hyperspectral imaging is a technique that captures both spatial (x, y) and spectral (\\u03bb) information reflecting the morphological and functional features of a sample. A 3D convolutional neural network deep learning model was developed to classify ductal carcinoma, non-ductal carcinoma, and normal human breast tissue ex vivo based on the hyperspectral imaging datacubes. The result showed that our system could perform the classification and make diagnosis predictions rapidly and accurately.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"INTRODUCTION\\nFlexible ureteroscopy (fURS) is the most common procedure for treatment of urolithiasis. We previously utilized kinematic evaluations of simulated fURS to demonstrate certain body movements are associated with efficient ureteroscopic manipulation for complex tasks. Herein, we incorporated computer vision to create an efficiency score using ureteroscope travel distance (DIST), task time (TIME), spectral arc length (SPARC), and percentage of purposeful wall collisions (COLL). The goal is a simulation-based system that can abstract these automated performance metrics (APMs) to differentiate between novice and expert ureteroscopic handling.\\n\\n\\nMETHODS\\nA ureteroscopic simulation box was used. Body kinematics, task time, and ureteroscopic movements were analyzed using a motion capture system and video camera. Optical flow computer vision was used to track the ureteroscope. DIST, TIME, and SPARC were automatically calculated. Wall collisions were automatically captured and independently judged by two authors; an algorithm was developed to automatically determine the COLL variable. A mixed effects model was used to aggregate these variables and distinguish between surgeons' first and final task attempts. The normalized values of these metrics were added to create a Composite Ureteroscopy Efficiency Score (CUES).\\n\\n\\nRESULTS\\n12 urologists completed the simulated tasks. The COLL assessment algorithm determined beneficial wall collisions with an accuracy of 77%. Normalized values of TIME, DIST, SPARC, and COLL were combined to create a composite ureteroscopic efficiency score (CUES). Compared to the first attempt, both the second and third attempts had statistically significant improvements in CUES. The ROC-AUC score reached 0.86, suggesting excellent discrimination between attempts. There was also a statistically significant difference in CUES when comparing resident and attending performance.\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nAutomated performance metrics can be abstracted using computer vision and artificial intelligence; an aggregate composite score (CUES) may be a promising method for evaluation of ureteroscopic efficiency.\\n\\n\\nFUNDING\\nEndoscopic equipment provided by Boston Scientific.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) in general and Natural Language Processing (NLP) in particular are paving the new way forward for the automated detection and prediction of mental health disorders among the population. Recent research in this area has prioritized predictive accuracy over model interpretability by relying on deep learning methods. However, prioritizing predictive accuracy over model interpretability can result in a lack of transparency in the decision-making process, which is critical in sensitive applications such as healthcare. There is thus a growing need for explainable AI (XAI) approaches to psychiatric diagnosis and prediction. The main aim of this work is to address a gap by conducting a systematic investigation of XAI approaches in the realm of automatic detection of mental disorders from language behavior leveraging textual data from social media. In pursuit of this aim, we perform extensive experiments to evaluate the balance between accuracy and interpretability across predictive mental health models. More specifically, we build BiLSTM models trained on a comprehensive set of human-interpretable features, encompassing syntactic complexity, lexical sophistication, readability, cohesion, stylistics, as well as topics and sentiment/emotions derived from lexicon-based dictionaries to capture multiple dimensions of language production. We conduct extensive feature ablation experiments to determine the most informative feature groups associated with specific mental health conditions. We juxtapose the performance of these models against a \\u201cblack-box\\u201d domain-specific pretrained transformer adapted for mental health applications. To enhance the interpretability of the transformers models, we utilize a multi-task fusion learning framework infusing information from two relevant domains (emotion and personality traits). Moreover, we employ two distinct explanation techniques: the local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) method and a model-specific self-explaining method (AGRAD). These methods allow us to discern the specific categories of words that the information-infused models rely on when generating predictions. Our proposed approaches are evaluated on two public English benchmark datasets, subsuming five mental health conditions (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression and psychological stress).\",\n",

In this study, natural language processing and supervised machine learning are used to create COMET, a tool for automatic classification and assessment of the effectiveness of interpersonal communication during software design meetings. To determine the optimal classification approach, nine different classifiers are examined. The classifier model that performed the best is Random Forest which managed to achieve 93.66% accuracy, 93.76% precision, and 93.63% recall when trained and tested with a stratified 10-fold cross-validation technique.\",\n",

Compared to the configuration without the second harmonic trap, the PA with the proposed second harmonic trap has improved linearity, gain, and PAE. The PA is implemented in a 2- ${\\\\mu }{\\\\text {m}}$ InGaP/GaAs HBT process, and the input and output TFs are built on a nine-layer printed circuit board. The fabricated PA achieves a small-signal gain of 23.3 dB, saturated output power of 33.5 dBm, and peak PAE of 45.9% at a collector voltage of 4.5 V over 5.15\\u20135.925 GHz under continuous-wave signal. A new radio (NR) 100-MHz QPSK CP 273 RB signal with a peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of 10.7 dB is used to test linearity. The PA achieves improved efficiency from 5.8%\\u20139% to 6.4%\\u201311.5% in the linear output power region which meeting adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR) of \\u221233 dBc.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"PurposeAt the beginning of the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a digitalized construction environments surfaced in the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in the form of a modern delivery system called demand controlled ventilation (DCV). Demand controlled ventilation has the potential to solve the building ventilation's biggest problem of managing indoor air quality (IAQ) for controlling COVID-19 transmission in indoor environments. However, the improper evaluation and information management of infection prevention on dense crowd activities such as measurement errors and volatile organic compound (VOC) generation failure rates, is fragmented so the aim of this research is to integrate this and explore potentials with machine learning algorithms (MLAs).Design/methodology/approachThe method used is a thorough systematic literature review (SLR) approach. The results of this research consist of a detailed description of the DCV system and digitalized construction process of its IAQ elements.FindingsThe discussion revealed that DCV has a potential for being further integrated by perceiving it as a MLAs and hereby enabling the management of IAQ level from the perspective of health risk function mechanism (i.e. VOC and CO2) for maintaining a comfortable thermal environment and save energy of public and private buildings (PPBs). The appropriate MLA can also be selected in different occupancy patterns for seasonal variations, ventilation behavior, building type and locations, as well as current indoor air pollution control strategies. Furthermore, the conceptual framework showed that MLA application such as algorithm design/Model Predictive Control (MPC) integration can alleviate the high spread limitation of COVID-19 in the indoor environment.Originality/valueFinally, the research concludes that a large unexploited potential within integration and innovation is recognized in the DCV system and MLAs which can be improved to optimize level of IAQ from the perspective of health throughout the building sector DCV process systems. The requirements of CO2 based DCV along with VOC concentrations monitoring practice should be taken into consideration through further research and experience with adaption and implementation from the ventilation control initial stage of the DCV process.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"In clinical practice, diseases with a prolonged course and disease characteristics at the time of diagnosis are often classified into specific stages. The precision of disease staging significantly impacts the therapeutic and curative outcomes for patients, and the diagnosis of multi-clinical-stage diseases based on electronic medical records is a problem that needs further research. Gout is a multi-stage disease. This paper focuses on the research of gout and proposes a staging diagnosis method for gout based on deep reinforcement learning. This method firstly uses the candidate binary classification model library for accurate diagnosis of gout, and then corrects the results of the binary classification through the set medical rules for diagnosis of gout, and then uses the machine learning model to diagnose different stages of corrected accurate data. In the course of the experiment, deep reinforcement learning was introduced to solve the hyperparameter tuning problem of the staging model. Through experiments conducted on 24,872 electronic medical records, the accuracy rate of gout diagnosis was found to be 90.03%, while the accuracy rate for diagnosing different stages of gout disease reached 86.85%. These findings serve as a valuable tool in assisting clinicians with accurate staging and diagnosis of gout. The application of deep reinforcement learning in gout staging diagnosis demonstrates a significant enhancement in diagnostic accuracy, thereby validating the effectiveness and feasibility of this method.\",\n",

Owing to the deficiency of fault samples and the variability of working conditions, these deep learning-based methods are limited in industrial applications. To address this problem, this study proposes a prior knowledge-based self-supervised learning (PKSSL) method for bearing fault diagnosis. In the PKSSL method, prior diagnostic knowledge is extracted by meta-learning from a few samples. Prior diagnostic knowledge is then utilized to guide the self-supervised learning (SSL) process to reduce reliance on training data. Furthermore, a graph convolutional network is introduced to fuse the information obtained by meta-learning and SSL, which makes the model fully utilize the learned information and improves the accuracy of the fault diagnosis. The effectiveness of the proposed method was validated using two datasets. The results demonstrate that compared to other existing approaches, the proposed method exhibits a strong generalization ability to transfer diagnostic knowledge from artificial damage data to real damage data under varied operating conditions.\",\n",

For tests on unpropped fractures, we incorporate the complexity in both form and response of natural fracture topography by using pristine natural fractures directly split along bedding planes. Under low shear stress, unpropped fracture is prohibited from slipping by strongly mated interlocking asperities. As we increase shear stress exceeding the frictional strength of the contact, it exhibits great conductivity enhancement upon fracture reactivation followed by immediate and continuous decay. If shear stress is loaded incrementally instead of instantaneously \\u2013 broadly representing different fracking fluid injection rate \\u2013 fracture conductivity response to shear deformation is considerably muted. Unpropped fracture behaviors are also found to be strongly related to fracture roughness and fidelity of the interlocking asperities, while less sensitive to background stress state. For propped fractures, we use manually ground fractures to specifically focus on the proppant impacts. In contrast to unpropped fractures, conductivity enhancement upon shear reactivation only presents where proppant is placed as non-uniformly distributed monolayer, which can be attributed to the generation of interparticle highly permeable flow paths. Otherwise, conductivity decreases as a result of proppant embedment, crushing, and compaction, however the reduction is muted with thicker proppant pack.\\n \\n \\n \\n The shale gas revolution dramatically changed the mix of energy supply in the United States over the past decade. The deployment of horizontal drilling and massive hydraulic fracturing to generate highly permeable flow paths has unlocked the massive store of hydrocarbons held in deep, ultralow-permeability shale reservoirs (Warpinski and Teufei, 1987; Maxwell et al., 2002; Taleghani and Olson, 2011; Taleghani et al., 2016).\\n\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Air pollution has become a big issue in the Northern part of Thailand due to forest fires, human activities, and seasonal climate. The air pollutant particulate matter (PM10) measurements from the Pollution Control Department (PCD) stations contain some missing values, which limit the capability in time-series prediction of future pollutant quantity. This research performs a preliminary study of PM10 time-series data imputation in three provinces in Thailand, including Chiang Mai, Lampang, and Nan. The evaluation was performed using three imputation methods: k-nearest neighbours (KNN), last observation carried forward (LOCF), and nearest observation carried backward (NOCB). NOCB obtains the highest R2, the lowest mean absolute error (MAE), and the lowest root mean squared error (RMSE) when tested with mimic missing data at varied proportions, ranging from 5% to 25% of the entire data. Imputed data as a result of NOCB underwent time-series data prediction of PM10 using long short-term memory (LSTM)-based neural networks. Prediction models were trained and tested based on the data splitting ratio of 80:20 from 2019 to 2020. The PM10 prediction model trained using imputed data leads to accurate prediction of unseen future data, achieving the R2 values of approximately 0.92.\",\n",

This study explored to identify the candidate drugs for prostate cancer by transcriptomic data and CMap database analysis. After integrating the results of omics analysis, bisoprolol is confirmed as a promising drug. Moreover, cell experiment reveals its potential inhibitory effect on the proliferation of prostate cancer cells. Importantly, machine learning methods are employed to predict the targets of bisoprolol, and the dual-target ADRB3 and hERG are explored by dynamic simulation. The findings of this study demonstrate the potential of bisoprolol as a multi-target drug for prostate cancer treatment and the feasibility of using beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitors in prostate cancer treatment. In addition, the proposed research approach is promising for discovering potential drugs for cancer treatment by leveraging the concept of drug side effects leading to anticancer effects. Further research is necessary to investigate the pharmacological action, potential toxicity, and underlying mechanisms of bisoprolol in treating prostate cancer with ADRB3.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

This study explores a machine-learning-based methodology for predicting a user\\u2019s gait subphase using inertial measurement units (IMUs) for a semiactive orthosis. A musculoskeletal simulation is employed with the help of existing experimental motion-capture data to obtain essential metrics related to the gait cycle, which are then normalized and scaled. A meticulous data capture methodology using foot switches is used for precise synchronization with IMU data, resulting in comprehensive labeled subphase datasets. The integration of simulation results and labeled datasets provides activation data for effective knee flexion damping following which multiple supervised machine learning algorithms are trained and evaluated for performances. The time series forest classifier emerged as the most suitable algorithm, with an accuracy of 86 percent, against randomized convolutional kernel transform, K-neighbor time series classifier, and long short-term memory\\u2013fully convolutional network, with accuracies of 68, 76, and 78, respectively, showcasing exceptional performance scores, thereby rendering it an optimal choice for identifying gait subphases and achieving the desired level of damping for magnetorheological brake-mounted knee orthosis based on simulated results.\",\n",

      "      \"title\": \"Discipline and Label: A WEIRD Genealogy and Social Theory of Data Annotation\",\n",
      "      \"abstract\": \"Data annotation remains the sine qua non of machine learning and AI. Recent empirical work on data annotation has begun to highlight the importance of rater diversity for fairness, model performance, and new lines of research have begun to examine the working conditions for data annotation workers, the impacts and role of annotator subjectivity on labels, and the potential psychological harms from aspects of annotation work. This paper outlines a critical genealogy of data annotation; starting with its psychological and perceptual aspects. We draw on similarities with critiques of the rise of computerized lab-based psychological experiments in the 1970's which question whether these experiments permit the generalization of results beyond the laboratory settings within which these results are typically obtained. Do data annotations permit the generalization of results beyond the settings, or locations, in which they were obtained? Psychology is overly reliant on participants from Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic societies (WEIRD). Many of the people who work as data annotation platform workers, however, are not from WEIRD countries; most data annotation workers are based in Global South countries. Social categorizations and classifications from WEIRD countries are imposed on non-WEIRD annotators through instructions and tasks, and through them, on data, which is then used to train or evaluate AI models in WEIRD countries. We synthesize evidence from several recent lines of research and argue that data annotation is a form of automated social categorization that risks entrenching outdated and static social categories that are in reality dynamic and changing. We propose a framework for understanding the interplay of the global social conditions of data annotation with the subjective phenomenological experience of data annotation work.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Periodontitis is a high prevalence dental disease caused by bacterial infection of the bone that surrounds the tooth. Early detection and precision treatment can prevent more severe symptoms such as tooth loss. Traditionally, periodontal disease is identified and labeled manually by dental professionals. The task requires expertise and extensive experience, and it is highly repetitive and time-consuming. The aim of this study is to explore the application of AI in the field of dental medicine. With the inherent learning capabilities, AI exhibits remarkable proficiency in processing extensive datasets and effectively managing repetitive tasks. This is particularly advantageous in professions demanding extensive experiential knowledge, such as dentistry. By harnessing AI, the potential arises to amplify process efficiency and velocity. In this study, bitewing radiographs are used as the image source, and there are two major steps to detect the dental symptoms including 1) tooth position identification; and 2) symptom identification. The study combines image enhancement techniques and tooth position identification using Gaussian filtering and adaptive binarization for data preprocessing, facilitated by the YOLOv4 model to precisely mark tooth positions. The subsequent step enhances symptom area visibility via contrast enhancement, utilizing a CNN model, particularly the AlexNet model, with significant improvements in caries recognition accuracy (92.85%) and restorations recognition accuracy (96.55%) compared to prior research. Moreover, the inclusion of periodontal disease symptoms achieves an accuracy of 91.13%. By harnessing deep learning techniques based on CNN models, this research enhances diagnostic precision, reduces errors, and increases efficiency for dentists, thereby providing meticulous and swift patient care. This innovation not only saves time but also has the potential for widespread implementation in remote and preventive medicine, aligning with the aspiration of universal health care accessibility.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"High-precision, short-term power forecasting for photovoltaic systems not only reduces unnecessary energy consumption but also provides power grid security. To this end, in this paper we propose a photovoltaic short-term power forecasting model based on the division of data of the 24 traditional Chinese solar terms and the Adaboost-GA-BP model. The 24 solar terms were condensed from the laws of meteorology, phenology, and seasonal changes to adapt to agricultural times in ancient China and have become intangible cultural heritage. This article first analyzes the numerical characteristics of meteorological factors and demonstrates their close correlation with the turning points of the 24 solar terms. Second, using Standardized Euclidean Distance and Spearman\\u2019s Correlation Coefficients to analyze data similarity between the Gregorian half-months and the 24 solar terms divisions for comparative analysis purposes, it is shown that the intragroup data under the division of the 24 solar terms have a higher similarity, leading to an average decrease of 15.68%, 40.57%, 14.68%, and 14.64% in the MAE, MSE, RMSE, and WMAPE of the predicted results, respectively. Finally, based on the data derived from the 24 solar terms, the combined algorithm was compared with the Adaboost-GA-BP model and then was verified. The genetic algorithm and Adaboost were used to optimize the BP neural network algorithm in initial value assignment and neural network structure, resulting in a 23.42%, 18.12%, and 22.28% reduction in the mean values of the MAE, RMSE, and WMAPE of the predicted results, respectively. Analysis of the results show that using the Adaboost-GA-BP model based on the 24 solar terms for short-term photovoltaic power forecasting can improve the accuracy of photovoltaic power forecasting and significantly improve the predictive performance of the model.\",\n",

Such visual limitations result in visually impaired individuals facing difficulties in accessing information quickly and performing daily activities like walking, driving, and more. Walking is one of the crucial activities for visually impaired individuals because it is one way to explore the world and engage in daily activities. Based on this issue, an assistive device for the visually impaired was designed using embedded system technology. In 2022, Serly Juliana Taneo, Jonshon Tarigan, Frederika Rambu Ngana, and Andreas Ch. Louk developed a mobility aid device for individuals with visual impairments using ultrasonic sensors for distance detection and Arduino as the microcontroller. However, the device primarily focused on mobility, and there is a need to add new features, such as emergency information using SMS technology that can send messages with the press of a button. The research results indicate that the ultrasonic sensor successfully triggers vibrations within a range of 1-100 cm, and the button can send emergency notifications via SMS when pressed. Therefore, it can be concluded that all connected components can function as intended. By combining SMS technology and ultrasonic sensors, this assistive device is expected to enhance the safety and independence of individuals with visual impairments as they navigate their surroundings.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Since light propagation in water bodies is subject to absorption and scattering effects, underwater images using only conventional intensity cameras will suffer from low brightness, blurred images, and loss of details. In this paper, a deep fusion network is applied to underwater polarization images; that is, the underwater polarization images are fused with intensity images using the deep learning method. To construct a training dataset, we establish an experimental setup to obtain underwater polarization images and perform appropriate transformations to expand the dataset. Next, an end-to-end learning framework based on unsupervised learning and guided by an attention mechanism is constructed for fusing polarization and light intensity images. The loss function and weight parameters are elaborated. The produced dataset is used to train the network under different loss weight parameters, and the fused images are evaluated based on different image evaluation metrics. The results show that the fused underwater images are more detailed. Compared with light intensity images, the information entropy and standard deviation of the proposed method increase by 24.48% and 139%. The image processing results are better than other fusion-based methods. In addition, the improved U-net network structure is used to extract features for image segmentation. The results show that the target segmentation based on the proposed method is feasible under turbid water. The proposed method does not require manual adjustment of weight parameters, has faster operation speed, and has strong robustness and self-adaptability, which is important for research in vision fields, such as ocean detection and underwater target recognition.\",\n",

However, there seems to be a bottleneck in extending the FEP to machine learning and implementing such models with neural networks. This paper gives a preliminary attempt at bridging FEP and machine learning, via a classical neural network model, the Helmholtz machine. As a variational machine learning model, the Helmholtz machine is optimized by minimizing its free energy, the same objective as FEP. Although the Helmholtz machine is not temporal, it gives an ideal parallel to the vanilla FEP and the hierarchical model of the brain, under which the active inference and predictive coding could be formulated coherently. Besides a detailed theoretical discussion, the paper also presents a preliminary experiment to validate the hypothesis. By fine-tuning the trained neural network through active inference, the model performance is promoted to accuracy above 99\\\\%. In the meantime, the data distribution is continuously deformed to a salience that conforms to the model representation, as a result of active sampling.\",\n",

Emotional paraphrasing, which changes the emotion embodied in a piece of text while preserving its meaning, has many potential applications, including moderating online dialogues and preventing cyberbullying. We introduce a new task of fine-grained emotional paraphrasing along emotion gradients, that is, altering the emotional intensities of the paraphrases in fine-grained settings following smooth variations in affective dimensions while preserving the meaning of the original text. We reconstruct several widely used paraphrasing datasets by augmenting the input and target texts with their fine-grained emotion labels. Then, we propose a framework for emotion and sentiment guided paraphrasing by leveraging pre-trained language models for conditioned text generation. Extensive evaluation of the fine-tuned models suggests that including fine-grained emotion labels in the paraphrase task significantly improves the likelihood of obtaining high-quality paraphrases that reflect the desired emotions while achieving consistently better scores in paraphrase metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR.\",\n",

This lack of research is even more pronounced when looking at cases that end with the death of the victim. In fact, all of the research looking at lethal outcomes in cases of abductions has focused exclusively on child victims and has failed to consider the interactions at the multivariate level between the factors related to the death of the victim. Therefore, the aim of the study is to identify offender and crime characteristics - as well as their interactions - associated with a lethal outcome in sexually-motivated abductions using a combination of logistic regression and neural network analyses on a sample of 281 cases (81 cases ending with a lethal outcome, random sample of 200 comparison cases). Findings show that sexually-motivated abductions ending with a lethal outcome are more likely to be characterized by an offender who is a loner, forensically aware, and who who uses a weapon and restraints, and who sexually penetrates and beats a known victim. The neural network analysis show that three different pathways lead to a lethal outcome in sexually-motivated abductions. Such findings are important for correctional practices.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Instruction tuning on a mixture of tasks has improved zero-shot capabilities in natural language processing (NLP). Nevertheless, existing methods often learn features that exhibit correlations between instruction-formatted samples and target labels, rather than causal relationships. Termed as ``spurious correlation'' in statistics, such a correlation may change drastically in a new task, making the effect from the learned features to be misleading. To this end, we develop a meta Structural Causal Model (meta-SCM) to integrate different NLP tasks under a single causal structure of the data. Specifically, the meta-SCM introduces multiple latent factors that represent properties of source context, only some of which causally influence the target labels for a specific task. The key idea is to learn task-required causal factors and only use those to make predictions for a given task. Theoretically, we prove the causal factor can be identified without mixing information from others. Guided by the identifiability, we propose a Structural Instruction Tuning (SIT) method to learn the task-required causal representations that can mimic the causal factors for each task. The utility of our approach is verified by improvements of zero-shot ability on a range of unseen datasets and tasks.\",\n",

Mathematically, this means one strives for networks with a small Lipschitz constant. Several recent works have focused on how to construct such Lipschitz networks, typically by imposing constraints on the weight matrices. In this work, we study an orthogonal aspect, namely the role of the activation function. We show that commonly used activation functions, such as MaxMin, as well as all piece-wise linear ones with two segments unnecessarily restrict the class of representable functions, even in the simplest one-dimensional setting. We furthermore introduce the new N-activation function that is provably more expressive than currently popular activation functions.

      "      \"abstract\": \"Background Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a major complication in patients admitted to Intensive Care Units (ICU), causing both clinical and economic burden on the healthcare system. This study develops a novel machine-learning (ML) model to predict, with several hours in advance, the AKI episodes of stage 2 and 3 (according to KDIGO definition) acquired in ICU. Methods A total of 16\\u2019760 ICU adult patients from 145 different ICU centers and 3 different countries (US, Netherland, Italy) are retrospectively enrolled for the study. Every hour the model continuously analyzes the routinely-collected clinical data to generate a new probability of developing AKI stage 2 and 3, according to KDIGO definition, during the ICU stay. Results The predictive model obtains an auROC of 0.884 for AKI (stage 2/3 KDIGO) prediction, when evaluated on the internal test set composed by 1\\u2019749 ICU stays from US and EU centers. When externally tested on a multi-centric US dataset of 6\\u2019985 ICU stays and multi-centric Italian dataset of 1\\u2019025 ICU stays, the model achieves an auROC of 0.877 and of 0.911, respectively. In all datasets, the time between model prediction and AKI (stage 2/3 KDIGO) onset is at least of 14 hours after the first day of ICU hospitalization. Conclusions In this study, a novel ML model for continuous and early AKI (stage 2/3 KDIGO) prediction is successfully developed, leveraging only routinely-available data. It continuously predicts AKI episodes during ICU stay, at least 14 hours in advance when the AKI episode happens after the first 24 hours of ICU admission. Its performances are validated in an extensive, multi-national and multi-centric cohort of ICU adult patients. This ML model overcomes the main limitations of currently available predictive models. The benefits of its real-world implementation enable an early proactive clinical management and the prevention of AKI episodes in ICU patients. Furthermore, the software could be directly integrated with IT system of the ICU.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Design rule checking (DRC) violation (DRV) prediction with early stage design information can help to reduce the iterations of design procedure and can speed up the physical-design closure. It is known that accurately predicting detailed routing-level DRV with information obtained at global route (GR) stage can significantly speed up the design closure. However, without sufficient prediction accuracy, the result may lead to suboptimal design or even longer design time. Therefore, in this article, we propose two machine-learning frameworks to predict the detailed routing-level DRV map of a given design. The first framework is based on the congestion report obtained at global routing stage, and the second framework considers both the placement information and the congestion report of global routing. We then compare the runtime and accuracy of the two models. The proposed frameworks utilize convolutional neural network as the core technique to train these prediction models. The training dataset is collected from 15 industrial designs using a leading commercial automatic placement and routing (APR) tool, and the total number of collected training samples exceeds 26M. A specialized under-sampling technique is also proposed to select important training samples for learning, compensate for the inaccuracy misled by a highly imbalanced training dataset, and speed up the entire training process. The experimental results demonstrate that our both models can result in not only a significantly higher accuracy than previous related works, but also a DRV map visually matching the actual ones closely. The average runtime of using our learned model from the first framework to generate a DRV map is only 3% of global routing, and the prediction accuracy of our learned model from the second framework can improve 7.6% compared to the one from the first framework. Our proposed framework can be viewed as a simple add-on tool to a current commercial placement and global router that can efficiently and effectively generate a more realistic DRV map without really applying detailed routing.\",\n",

The classification can be used to bin an analysis region to enhance the expected significance for a mass resonance search.

In this work, an event classifier transformer is proposed to bin an analysis region, in which the network is trained with special techniques. The techniques developed here can enhance the significance and reduce the correlation between the network's output and the reconstructed mass.

Nodes with the best information dissemination effect are expected to be selected. At present, algorithms and diffusive models have been developed, and the IM problem can be solved as a continuous parameter optimization one. Although encouraging results can be obtained, the existing studies have not considered the impact by different coding methods of the seed determination process. Focusing on this deficiency, this paper proposes an algorithm framework combined the graph embedding method with the deep reinforcement learning to iteratively search for competitive seeds under a genetic framework, termed SDNE-GDRL. Both optimal and structural information are considered to guarantee the search ability. Experiments have been conducted on several networks with different sizes, which reveal that the proposed algorithm shows superiority over existing approaches.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Sign language recognition (SLR) aims to break the communication barrier between hearing-impaired individuals and others, and is beneficial in building an inclusive and caring society. This paper aims to achieve real-time static sign language interpretation from images employing deep learning methods. Conventionally, a pipeline approach is used to locate the position of the hand gesture in an image and then classify the gesture. You Only Look Once version 5 (YOLOv5) is a suitable model that captures the hand gesture with bounding boxes and predicts the gesture with a convolution-based classifier. However, in practice, SLR performance may be significantly affected when gestures are partially occluded, or the background environment is complicated. Therefore, this paper proposes a method using MediaPipe Hands to enhance hand features, enabling YOLOv5 to locate the hand position more precisely. In addition, MediaPipe Hands can predict finger position even when the hand is partly obscured, providing essential features in the classification stage. In experiments, MediaPipe Hands improves the success rate of hand localization in complex environments and increase hand gesture classification accuracy. Compared to the baseline model, the model employing features enhanced by MediaPipe Hands outperformed those without MediaPipe Hands in static sign language recognition (SSLR1). Moreover, our method was tested in real-life scenarios by implementing a web service application and demonstrated improved real-time recognition performance.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Objective: Machine learning methods hold the promise of leveraging available data and generating higher quality data while alleviating the data collection burden on healthcare professionals. International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnoses data, collected globally for billing and epidemiological purposes, represents a valuable source of structured information. However, ICD coding is a challenging task. While numerous previous studies reported promising results in automatic ICD classification, they often describe input data specific model architectures, that are heterogeneously evaluated with different performance metrics and ICD code subsets. This study aims to explore the evaluation and construction of more effective Computer Assisted Coding (CAC) systems using generic approaches, focusing on the use of ICD hierarchy, medication data and a feed forward neural network architecture. Methods: We conduct comprehensive experiments using the MIMIC-III clinical database, mapped to the OMOP data model. Our evaluations encompass various performance metrics, alongside investigations into multitask, hierarchical, and imbalanced learning for neural networks. Results: We introduce a novel metric, RE@R, tailored to the ICD coding task, which offers interpretable insights for healthcare informatics practitioners, aiding them in assessing the quality of assisted coding systems. Our findings highlight that selectively cherry-picking ICD codes diminish retrieval performance without performance improvement over the selected subset. We show that optimizing for metrics such as NDCG and AUPRC outperforms traditional F1-based metrics in ranking performance. We observe that Neural Network training on different ICD levels simultaneously offers minor benefits for ranking and significant runtime gains. However, our models do not derive benefits from hierarchical or class imbalance correction techniques for ICD code retrieval. Conclusion: This study offers valuable insights for researchers and healthcare practitioners interested in developing and evaluating CAC systems. Using a straightforward sequential neural network model, we confirm that medical prescriptions are a rich data source for CAC systems, providing competitive retrieval capabilities for a fraction of the computational load compared to text-based models. Our study underscores the importance of metric selection and challenges existing practices related to ICD code sub-setting for model training and evaluation.\",\n",

These networks exhibit high-impact technological innovations, such as cloud computing, mobility, new traffic profiles, network functions virtualization (NFV), the Internet of things (IoT), Big Data, among others. Network automation is a methodology in which physical and virtual network devices are automatically configured, provisioned, managed, and tested using software. Large enterprises such as Cisco, Juniper, Red Hat, and VMWare offer proprietary solutions for network automation. Additionally, the number of tools assisting in network automation has recently increased. Taken together, these developments have changed the way administrators build and manage networks. In this regard, most large communications operators are now working and moving toward truly autonomous networks that will eventually require an intensive use of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Advances in the area show that three specific segments \\u2014CSPs, Cloud Providers, and Enterprises\\u2014 are all at different stages of automation maturity.

      "      \"abstract\": \"The copper (Cu) biotic ligand model (BLM) has been used for ecological risk assessment by taking into account the bioavailability of Cu in freshwater. The Cu BLM requires data for many water chemistry variables, such as pH, major cations, and dissolved organic carbon, which can be difficult to obtain from water quality monitoring programs. To develop an optimized predicted no\\u2010effect concentration (PNEC) estimation model based on an available monitoring dataset, we proposed an initial model that considers all BLM variables, a second model that requires variables excluding alkalinity, and a third model using electrical conductivity as a surrogate for the major cations and alkalinity. Furthermore, deep neural network (DNN) models have been used to predict the nonlinear relationships between the PNEC (outcome variable) and the required input variables (explanatory variables). The predictive capacity of DNN models was compared with the results of other existing PNEC estimation tools using a look\\u2010up table and multiple linear and multivariate polynomial regression methods. Three DNN models, using different input variables, provided better predictions of the Cu PNECs compared with the existing tools for the following four test datasets: Korean, United States, Swedish, and Belgian freshwaters. Consequently, it is expected that Cu BLM\\u2013based risk assessment can be applied to various monitoring datasets, and that the most applicable model among the three different types of DNN models could be selected according to data availability for a given monitoring database.

Current methods of trajectory clustering rely on a distance measure between two points in order to measure the dissimilarity between two trajectories, causing problems of both effectiveness and efficiency. In this paper, we propose a new IDK-based clustering algorithm, called TIDKC, which makes full use of the distributional kernel for trajectory similarity measuring and clustering. TIDKC identifies non-linearly separable clusters with irregular shapes and varied densities in linear time. It does not rely on random initialisation and is robust to outliers. An extensive evaluation on 7 large real-world trajectory datasets confirms that IDK is more effective in capturing complex structures in trajectories than traditional and deep learning-based distance measures.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"There is mounting experimental evidence that brain-state specific neural mechanisms supported by connectomic architectures serve to combine past and contextual knowledge with current, incoming flow of evidence (e.g. from sensory systems). Such mechanisms are distributed across multiple spatial and temporal scales and require dedicated support at the levels of individual neurons and synapses. A prominent feature in the neocortex is the structure of large, deep pyramidal neurons which show a peculiar separation between an apical dendritic compartment and a basal dentritic/peri-somatic compartment, with distinctive patterns of incoming connections and brain-state specific activation mechanisms, namely apical-amplification, -isolation and -drive associated to the wakefulness, deeper NREM sleep stages and REM sleep. The cognitive roles of apical mechanisms have been demonstrated in behaving animals. In contrast, classical models of learning spiking networks are based on single compartment neurons that miss the description of mechanisms to combine apical and basal/somatic information. This work aims to provide the computational community with a two-compartment spiking neuron model which includes features that are essential for supporting brain-state specific learning and with a piece-wise linear transfer function (ThetaPlanes) at highest abstraction level to be used in large scale bio-inspired artificial intelligence systems. A machine learning algorithm, constrained by a set of fitness functions, selected the parameters defining neurons expressing the desired apical mechanisms.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Due to the rapid development of digitalization and information technology, the study of intelligent information systems (IIS) in the banking sector is becoming an urgent task. Intelligent information systems are able to optimize banking processes, increase security, improve the quality of customer service, mitigate risks, and optimize internal processes of financial stability management. The purpose of this study is to reveal the potential and impact of IIS on banking management processes; to study their capabilities. To achieve this goal, this study used an analytical approach, in particular, methods of information and morphological data analysis, as well as the method of generalization, which allowed the identification of key aspects, features, and properties of intelligent information systems of the banking sector, and to provide a generalized structure of their functioning by the relevant processes. This article generalizes a group of intelligent information systems of the banking sector (IISBS), their general features and properties, proposes an innovative architecture of financial management support, and identifies their advantages in comparison with existing intelligent systems. The study proves that intelligent information systems of the banking sector are endowed with hybrid data analytics provided by deep learning methods using self-learning algorithms; are able to assess possible risks and plan strategies for their resolution; recognize unauthorized entries and suspicious transactions; thanks to virtual assistants, are suitable for robotizing management processes; and visually present the results of analysing large amounts of data in real time. The research conducted in this paper shows that the introduction of intelligent information systems in the banking sector is of high practical value, as it provides interactivity and personalization for customers, online interaction, and support in solving problems through various communication channels\",\n",

However, specialized hardware is required that supports computations with low bit widths to take advantage of such optimizations. In this work, we propose permutations on subword level that build on top of multi-bit-width multiply-accumulate operations to effectively support low bit width computations of quantized NNs. By applying this technique, we extend the data reuse and further improve compute performance for convolution operations compared to simple vectorization using SIMD (single-instruction-multiple-data). We perform a design space exploration using a cycle accurate simulation with MobileNet and VGG16 on a vector-based processor. The results show a speedup of up to $3.7\\\\times$ and a reduction of up to $1.9\\\\times$ for required data transfers. Additionally, the control overhead for orchestrating the computation is decreased by up to $3.9\\\\times$.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Beamforming techniques are considered as essential parts to compensate the severe path loss in millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications by adopting large antenna arrays and formulating narrow beams to obtain satisfactory received powers. However, performing accurate beam alignment over such narrow beams for efficient link configuration by traditional beam selection approaches, mainly relied on channel state information, typically impose significant latency and computing overheads, which is often infeasible in vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications like highly dynamic scenarios. In contrast, utilizing out-of-band contextual information, such as vehicular position information, is a potential alternative to reduce such overheads. In this context, this paper presents a deep learning-based solution on utilizing the vehicular position information for predicting the optimal beams having sufficient mmWave received powers so that the best V2V line-of-sight links can be ensured proactively. After experimental evaluation of the proposed solution on real-world measured mmWave sensing and communications datasets, the results show that the solution can achieve up to 84.58% of received power of link status on average, which confirm a promising solution for beamforming in mmWave at 60 GHz enabled V2V communications.\",\n",

We analysed two epochs of data obtained by the Magellan Clay Telescope during two consecutive nights, when the source was in a soft X-ray spectral state. We identified typical emission lines from outbursting low-mass X-ray binaries, such as the hydrogen Balmer series He ii \\\\, and the Bowen blend. We focused our analysis on the prominent $ H line, which exhibits asymmetric emission and variable absorption components. We applied both traditional analytical methods and machine-learning techniques in order to explore the association of the absorption features with outflowing phenomena, and we conclude that they are best explained by broad absorption. This result is consistent with reports from other outbursting BHs, where optical outflows have predominantly been observed in the hard state. Further observations at different X-ray states are key to properly test whether this behaviour is universal and to determine the implications for the disc wind physics.\",\n",

      "      \"title\": \"Assessing the Feasibility of Developing a White Label SD-WAN Solution for Smart Cities\",\n",
      "      \"abstract\": \"Recently, many researchers have tried to answer a question regarding smart cities: how to connect a wide variety of sensors and aggregate the data collected by different technologies related to the Internet of Things (IoT)? Those data are usually gathered and transmitted through WAN (Wide Area Network) or private MPLS (Multi-Protocol Label Switching) connections. However, since WAN based solutions present different resources in terms of data, size, coverage area, latency and capacity requirements, they become inefficient or even prohibitive regarding operating costs on smart city applications. An alternative is the use of SD-WAN (Software-Defined Wide Area Network), which combines hardware and software appliances or is software based only, consisting of the virtualization of WAN connections. The main characteristics of SD-WAN are: the ability to do dynamic path selection, facilitating data flow and increasing system resilience; the support to multiple connection types (ADSL, VDSL, FTTH, 3G/4G or 5G), enlarging the coverage area when compared with traditional WAN; the employment of a simple interface (easy to configure and manage); the capital and operation expenditure reduction; the increase of service agility and flexibility; the implementation of a centralized control and monitoring with lower costs. In this sense, this paper proposes an SD-WAN embedded white-label solution, of low cost and low energy consumption for commercial and academic use employing Ubuntu Linux, Floodlight SDN Controller, Open vSwitch and Raspberry Pi 3b. Then, the Quality of Service (QoS) parameters obtained by the proposed SD-WAN solution are measured and evaluated, through network emulation tests performed with the aid of Distributed Internet Traffic Generator (D-ITG), in order to verify the applicability in smart cities.\",\n",

This paper addresses this gap by adopting the novel Timing Diversity approach from the real-time community and adapting it to the avionics domain to achieve a reliable and safe timing behavior on system-level. Timing Diversity provides a safety net to handle unexpected timing outliers of multi-core processors by exploiting existing modular redundancy. The system design is illustrated using a neural network-based runway detection, deploying different multi-core hardware and diverse software algorithms. Furthermore, error handling and compliance to current acceptable means according to AMC 20-193 are discussed.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Irregular sampling of time series in electronic health records (EHRs) is one of the main challenges for developing machine learning models. Additionally, the pattern of missing data in certain clinical variables is not at random but depends on the decisions of clinicians and the state of the patient. Point process is a mathematical framework for analyzing event sequence data that is consistent with irregular sampling patterns. Our model, TEE4EHR, is a transformer event encoder (TEE) with point process loss that encodes the pattern of laboratory tests in EHRs. The utility of our TEE has been investigated in a variety of benchmark event sequence datasets. Additionally, we conduct experiments on two real-world EHR databases to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of our model. Firstly, in a self-supervised learning approach, the TEE is jointly learned with an existing attention-based deep neural network which gives superior performance in negative log-likelihood and future event prediction. Besides, we propose an algorithm for aggregating attention weights that can reveal the interaction between the events. Secondly, we transfer and freeze the learned TEE to the downstream task for the outcome prediction, where it outperforms state-of-the-art models for handling irregularly sampled time series. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that our approach can improve representation learning in EHRs and can be useful for clinical prediction tasks.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The low adoption of insurance by potential policyholders in developing countries like Kenya is a cause for concern for insurers, regulators, and other marketing stakeholders. To effectively design targeted marketing strategies to boost insurance adoption, it is crucial to determine the factors that affect insurance uptake among potential policyholders. In this study, the 2021 FinAccess Survey, which interviewed sampled individuals above 16 years in Kenya and machine learning techniques, including Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression, were utilized to uncover the factors driving insurance uptake and the reasons for the low adoption of insurance among potential policyholders. Random Forest was the most robust model of the three classifiers based on Kappa score, recall score, F1 score, precision, and area under the operating characteristic curve (approaching 1). The paper explores eight reasons why people currently do not have insurance policies. The results indicated that affordability was the primary driver of uptake with 68.67% of having expressed a desire to possess insurance but are unable to afford it. The highest level of education being the next most significant factor. Cultural and religious beliefs and mistrust of insurance providers were found to have a minimal impact on uptake. These findings imply that offering affordable insurance products and conducting awareness campaigns are critical to increase insurance adoption.\",\n",

In this paper, we introduce a novel transformer-based approach called $LMOD$ ( Label-based Missing Object Detection) to teach scene contextual knowledge to machines using an attention mechanism. A distinctive aspect of the proposed approach is its reliance solely on labels from image datasets to teach scene context, entirely eliminating the need for the actual image itself. We show how scene-wide relationships among different objects can be learned using a self-attention mechanism. We further show that the contextual knowledge gained from label based learning can enhance performance of other visual based object detection algorithm.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Data and privacy laws, such as the GDPR, require mobile apps that collect and process the personal data of their citizens to have a legally-compliant policy. Since these mobile apps are hosted on app distribution platforms such as Google Play Store and App Store, the app publishers also require the app developers who wish to submit a new app or make changes to an existing app to be transparent about their app privacy practices regarding handling sensitive user data that requires sensitive permissions such as calendar, camera, microphone. To verify compliance with privacy regulators and app distribution platforms, the app privacy policies and permissions are investigated for consistency. However, little has been done to investigate GDPR completeness checking within the Android permission ecosystem. In this paper, we investigate the design and runtime approaches towards completeness checking of sensitive (\\u2018dangerous\\u2019) Android permission policy declarations against GDPR. In this paper, we investigate the design and runtime approaches towards completeness checking of dangerous Android permission policy declarations against GDPR. Leveraging the MPP-270 annotated corpus that describes permission declarations in application privacy policies, six natural language processing and language modelling algorithms are developed to measure permission completeness during runtime while a proof of concept Class Unified Modeling Language Diagram (UML) tool is developed to generate GDPR-compliant permission policy declarations using UML diagrams during design time. This paper makes a significant contribution to the identification of appropriate permission policy declaration methodologies that a developer can use to target particular GDPR laws, increasing GDPR compliance by 12% in cases during runtime using BERT word embedding, measuring GDPR compliance in permission policy sentences, and a UML-driven tool to generate compliant permission declarations.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"\\n \\n Competency-based medical education (CBME) is a method of medical training that focuses on developing learners\\u2019 competencies rather than simply assessing their knowledge and skills. Attitude, ethics, and communication (AETCOM) are important components of CBME, and the use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT for CBME has not been studied. Hence, we aimed to assess the capability of ChatGPT in solving AETCOM case scenarios used for CBME in India.\\n \\n \\n \\n A total of 11 case scenarios were developed based on the AETCOM competencies. The scenarios were presented to ChatGPT, and the responses generated by ChatGPT were evaluated by three independent experts by awarding score ranging from 0 to 5. The scores were compared with a predefined score of 2.5 (50% accuracy) and 4 (80% accuracy) of a one-sample median test. Scores among the three raters were compared by the Kruskal\\u2013Wallis H test. The inter-rater reliability of the evaluations was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).\\n \\n \\n \\n The mean score of solution provided by ChatGPT was 3.88 \\u00b1 0.47 (out of 5), indicating an accuracy of approximately 78%. The responses evaluated by three raters were similar (Kruskal\\u2013Wallis H P value 0.51), and the ICC value was 0.796, which indicates a relatively high level of agreement among the raters.\\n \\n \\n \\n ChatGPT shows moderate capability in solving AETCOM case scenarios used for CBME in India. The inter-rater reliability of the evaluations suggests that ChatGPT\\u2019s responses were consistent and reliable. Further studies are needed to explore the potential of ChatGPT and other AI tools in CBME and to determine the optimal use of these tools in medical education.\\n\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Geolocated social media data hold a hitherto untapped potential for exploring the relationship between user mobility and their interests at a large scale. Using geolocated Twitter data from Nigeria, we provide a feasibility study that demonstrates how the linkage of (1) a trajectory analysis of Twitter users' geolocation and (2) natural language processing of Twitter users' text content can reveal information about the interests of migrants. After identifying migrants via a trajectory analysis, we train a language model to automatically detect the topics of the migrants' tweets. Biases of manual labelling are circumvented by learning community\\u2010defined topics from a Nigerian web forum. Results suggest that differences in users' mobility correlate with varying interests in several topics, most notably religion. We find that Twitter data can be a flexible source for exploring the link between users' mobility and interests in large\\u2010scale analyses of urban populations. The joint use of spatial techniques and text analysis enables migration researchers to (a) study migrant perspectives in greater detail than is possible with census data and (b) at a larger scale than is feasible with interviews. Thereby, it provides a valuable complement to interviews, surveys\\u00a0and censuses, and holds a large potential for further research.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The structure and topology of chemical compounds can be determined using chemical graph theory. Using topological indices, we may uncover much about connectivity, complexity, and other important aspects of molecules. Numerous research investigations have been conducted on the K-Banhatti indices and entropy measurements in various fields, including the study of natural polymers, nanotubes, and catalysts. At the same time, the Shannon entropy of a graph is widely used in network science. It is employed in evaluating several networks, including social networks, neural networks, and transportation systems. The Shannon entropy enables the analysis of a network\\u2019s topology and structure, facilitating the identification of significant nodes or structures that substantially impact network operation and stability. In the past decade, there has been a considerable focus on investigating a range of nanostructures, such as nanosheets and nanoparticles, in both experimental and theoretical domains. As a very effective catalyst and inert substrate, the MgO nanostructure has received a lot of interest. The primary objective of this research is to study different indices and employ them to look at entropy measures of magnesium oxide(111) nanosheets over a wide range of p values, including p=1,2,3,\\u22ef,j. Additionally, we conducted a linear regression analysis to establish the correlation between indices and entropies.\",\n",

However, emotion preservation is crucial for natural human-computer interaction. The well-known voice conversion technique StarGANv2-VC achieves anonymisation but fails to preserve emotion. This work presents an any-to-many semi-supervised StarGANv2-VC variant trained on partially emotion-labelled non-parallel data. We propose emotion-aware losses computed on the emotion embeddings and acoustic features correlated to emotion. Additionally, we use an emotion classifier to provide direct emotion supervision. Objective and subjective evaluations show that the proposed approach significantly improves emotion preservation over the vanilla StarGANv2-VC. This considerable improvement is seen over diverse datasets, emotions, target speakers, and inter-group conversions without compromising intelligibility and anonymisation.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Over the years, the humanities community has increasingly requested the creation of artificial intelligence frameworks to help the study of cultural heritage. Document Layout segmentation, which aims at identifying the different structural components of a document page, is a particularly interesting task connected to this trend, specifically when it comes to handwritten texts. While there are many effective approaches to this problem, they all rely on large amounts of data for the training of the underlying models, which is rarely possible in a real-world scenario, as the process of producing the ground truth segmentation task with the required precision to the pixel level is a very time-consuming task and often requires a certain degree of domain knowledge regarding the documents at hand. For this reason, in this paper, we propose an effective few-shot learning framework for document layout segmentation relying on two novel components, namely a dynamic instance generation and a segmentation refinement module. This approach is able of achieving performances comparable to the current state of the art on the popular Diva-HisDB dataset, while relying on just a fraction of the available data.\",\n",

The method can accurately classify and identify faults from overcurrent signals including constant impedance faults, inrush currents, and capacitive switching disturbances. First, the features of the overcurrent signal are extracted by wavelet transform. Then, construct a convolutional neural network, adjust network parameters through training, and establish a mapping relationship between input features and category codes. In order to solve the problems of training overfitting and learning efficiency, this paper modifies the loss function and uses the method of adaptive learning rate to optimize the convolutional neural network. Through simulation experiments, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified, indicating that the method can effectively classify overcurrent signals, accurately identify early cable faults, and has high engineering application value. The research results of this method are of great significance for eliminating hidden dangers of cable faults in time.\",\n",

Although considerable efforts have been devoted to the construction of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)-based porous nano-reactors, their enzymolysis efficiency cannot be tuned by varying the external conditions due to the fixed conformation of the encapsulated enzymes. In this work, a controllable embedding protocol was developed based on the concept of stimuli-responsive polymer modified MOFs. Using MOFs as a rigid template for thermo-responsive polymer modification and consequently utilizing the polymer-MOFs complexes for enzyme (glucose oxidase, horseradish peroxidase, trypsin, cytochrome c, glutaminase) immobilization, different porous nano-reactors were fabricated. Most importantly, the polymer on the MOF surface exhibited good ability to form a \\\"soft nest\\\" at high temperature for inducing the confinement effect and further improving the enzymolysis efficiencies of the nano-reactors 3.75-37.7-fold. Moreover, a colorimetric sensing method was developed to detect serum glucose with the proposed nano-reactors. This strategy is highly versatile and suitable for diverse rigid MOFs modified with stimuli-responsive soft-polymer-nests and enzymes.\",\n",

Contrarily, storing and operating information and maintaining its confidentiality and security is a concerning issue in the IoT. Throughout the whole operational process, considering transparency in its privacy, data protection, and disaster recovery, it needs state-of-the-art systems and methods to tackle the evolving environment. This research aims to improve the security of IoT devices by investigating the likelihood of network attacks utilizing ordinary device network data and attack network data acquired from similar statistics. To achieve this, IoT devices dedicated to smart healthcare systems were utilized, and botnet attacks were conducted on them for data generation. The collected data were then analyzed using statistical measures, such as the Pearson coefficient and entropy, to extract relevant features. Machine learning algorithms were implemented to categorize normal and attack traffic with data preprocessing techniques to increase accuracy. One of the most popular datasets, known as BoT-IoT, was cross-evaluated with the generated dataset for authentication of the generated dataset. The research provides insight into the architecture of IoT devices, the behavior of normal and attack networks on these devices, and the prospects of machine learning approaches to improve IoT device security. Overall, the study adds to the growing body of knowledge on IoT device security and emphasizes the significance of adopting sophisticated strategies for detecting and mitigating network attacks.\",\n",

The data for this study was used from the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency's 2021 Community Health Survey. 4,602 data from metropolitan cities were used, and 19,545 data from metropolitan provinces were used. The big data used in data analysis was subjected to frequency analysis, T-test, variance analysis, and Random Forest analysis, a machine learning technique, using R 4.3.0 for Windows. As a result of the study, there was no problem of overfitting between train and test data, and the classification model of the machine learning technique was found to be at about 94%. As a result of the analysis, the importance of experiencing depression was different between large cities and local cities. It is believed that more efficient policy establishment will be possible by approaching the causes of depression experienced by citizens in the two regions differently.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"e15038 Background: We developed ASPYRE technology to make detection of genomic variants in oncology patients more accessible. Although ASPYRE is not traditional PCR, it can be performed using standard qPCR instruments on nucleic acid extracted from FFPE tissue or plasma and is therefore easily adoptable by clinical laboratories. Using ASPYRE, we designed a targeted panel called ASPYRE-LungTM consisting of 114 variants in 11 genes ( ALK, BRAF, EGFR, ERBB2, KRAS, RET, ROS1, MET & NTRK1/2/3) to inform the clinical management of patients with NSCLC. We have previously published general assay descriptions of ASPYRE-Lung (Silva et al., 2021, Scientific Reports and Gray et al., 2022, BMC Medical Genomics). Here we extend our prior studies with a detailed analytic performance assessment across all variants using precisely controlled synthetic samples. We determined assay-wide performance using samples with low variant allele fractions (VAFs) near the limit of detection (LoD) of the assay and compared results across 2 separate laboratory settings. Methods: Nine independent batches of reagents were split between 2 laboratories. Contrived test samples were prepared with known VAFs (DNA variants) or copy numbers (RNA variants). Each sample contained a single variant with VAFs of 0.1-0.5% for DNA variants, and 6-150 copies for RNA variants. Multiple replicates were performed at both testing sites using 20ng DNA/6ng RNA. Data was processed using an internally designed algorithm and analyzed using a machine learning classifier which determined the presence or absence of each individual variant. Results: Study data resulted in a total of 133,083 variant calls from 2,319 samples. For each variant at each VAF or copy number, the detection rate was calculated, and the results for each variant were used to calculate an LoD95 using probit regression. Target assay specifications and the assay-wide analytical performance data are shown in the table below. Conclusions: The data show that ASPYRE-Lung meets or exceeds target specifications for the detection of single nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertions/deletions (indels), and gene fusions. Estimates of LoD for key variants fall within target specifications, and assay-wide performance demonstrates highly sensitive detection of each class of variant. Performance was similar at the two laboratory sites further supporting the clinical potential of the assay. Moreover, the assay only requires 20ng DNA and as little as 6ng RNA, depending on sample type, so it is highly suitable for use with typical NSCLC patient samples such as needle core biopsies or plasma where available nucleic acid may be limited. This data supports further clinical development of ASPYRE-Lung. [Table: see text]\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"This article addresses the challenge of validating the admission committee's decisions for undergraduate admissions. In recent years, the traditional review process has struggled to handle the overwhelmingly large amount of applicants' data. Moreover, this traditional assessment often leads to human bias, which might result in discrimination among applicants. Although classical machine learning-based approaches exist that aim to verify the quantitative assessment made by the application reviewers, these methods lack scalability and suffer from performance issues when a large volume of data is in place. In this context, we propose deep learning-based classifiers, namely Feed-Forward and Input Convex neural networks, which overcome the challenges faced by the existing methods. Furthermore, we give additional insights into our model by incorporating an interpretability module, namely LIME. Our training and test datasets comprise applicants' data with a wide range of variables and information. Our models achieve higher accuracy compared to the best-performing traditional machine learning-based approach by a considerable margin of 3.03 %. Additionally, we show the sensitivity of different features and their relative impacts on the overall admission decision using the LIME technique.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Abstract: In an decreasingly digital and data- driven world, personalization of services and happy recommendation is an important aspect to ameliorate the stoner experience. In recent times, there has been a major elaboration in music recommendation system, fasteningon stoner sentiment and song characteristics. The proposed system takes advantage of the idea that visual stimulants, similar as the content of images, can be used to infer the stoner's emotional state. By recycling facial expressions and other visual cues, the system detects and classifies feelings similar as happiness, sadness, wrathfulness and others. This emotional data is also used to elect music tracks that align with the detected emotional state. The recommendation system frame is displayed by druggies rulings that enable song recommendation on the bases of the stoner's preferences or intensity of current feelings. Playing music based on the mood of the user is an application of deep learning which is introduced to the listeners. This can be done by figuring out the user's facial expression which depicts their mood.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Video Text Spotting (VTS) is a fundamental visual task that aims to predict the trajectories and content of texts in a video. Previous works usually conduct local associations and apply IoU-based distance and complex post-processing procedures to boost performance, ignoring the abundant temporal information and the morphological characteristics in VTS. In this paper, we propose a novel Global Video Text Spotting Transformer GloTSFormer to model the tracking problem as global associations and utilize the Gaussian Wasserstein distance to guide the morphological correlation between frames. Our main contributions can be summarized as three folds. 1). We propose a Transformer-based global tracking method GloTSFormer for VTS and associate multiple frames simultaneously. 2). We introduce a Wasserstein distance-based method to conduct positional associations between frames. 3). We conduct extensive experiments on public datasets. On the ICDAR2015 video dataset, GloTSFormer achieves 56.0 MOTA with 4.6 absolute improvement compared with the previous SOTA method and outperforms the previous Transformer-based method by a significant 8.3 MOTA.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"In India, nearly two lakh people rely on apple production for a living, with apples accounting for approximately 16% of GDP in their respective states. Although apple production is second only to that of other fruits in terms of volume, it generates more revenue. In addition, India ranks fifth in total apple production worldwide. As a result, the apple is a fruit that has a significant impact on our economic situation. Apple productivity is primarily influenced by leaf diseases such as scab, cedar rust, black rot, and others. To prevent apple leaf diseases from spreading throughout the tree, it is critical to detect them in their early stages of infection. We proposed a Convolutional Neural Network methodology to detect these leaf diseases accurately and efficiently.The image pre-processing and augmentation methods help us distinguish the region of interest from the background. We then trained and validated our dataset of apple leaf images by applying Deep Learning algorithms. This paper compares the DenseNet and AlexNet algorithms, for a dataset of 5828 images. The results prove that DenseNet is more suitable for disease prediction, as it produces 98.17% accurate results.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Deep Learning has enabled significant progress towards more accurate predictions and is increasingly integrated into our everyday lives in real-world applications; this is true especially for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in the field of image analysis. Nevertheless, it has been shown that Deep Learning is vulnerable against well-crafted, small perturbations to the input, i.e., adversarial examples. Defending against such attacks is therefore crucial to ensure the proper functioning of these models\\u2014especially when autonomous decisions are taken in safety-critical applications, such as autonomous vehicles. In this work, shallow machine learning models, such as Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine, are utilised as surrogates of a CNN based on the assumption that they would be differently affected by the minute modifications crafted for CNNs. We develop three detection strategies for adversarial examples by analysing differences in the prediction of the surrogate and the CNN model: namely, deviation in (i) the prediction, (ii) the distance of the predictions, and (iii) the confidence of the predictions. We consider three different feature spaces: raw images, extracted features, and the activations of the CNN model. Our evaluation shows that our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to other approaches, such as Feature Squeezing, MagNet, PixelDefend, and Subset Scanning, on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets while being robust in the sense that they do not entirely fail against selected single attacks. Further, we evaluate our defence against an adaptive attacker in a grey-box setting.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"This article presents the development of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the estimation of lattice parameters in organic compounds across various crystal systems. A comprehensive collection of 92,085 organic compounds was utilized to train the CNNs, encompassing crystals with unit cells containing up to 512 atoms and a maximum unit cell volume of 8000 \\u00c53. Simulated diffraction patterns were generated for each compound, comprising four diffraction patterns with different crystal sizes. These diffraction patterns were generated within a 2\\u03b8 window of 3-60\\u00b0, employing a step size of 0.02051\\u00b0. Two distinct CNN architectures were developed with differing input data. The first CNN, referred to as XRD-CNN, was trained solely on diffraction patterns. In the test set, XRD-CNN demonstrated a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 11.04% for unit cell vectors, 7.40% for angles, and 26.83% for unit cell volume. The second CNN, XRDElem-CNN, incorporated a binary representation of atoms within the unit cell as an additional input. XRDElem-CNN achieved improved performance, yielding MAPE values of 4.73% for unit vectors, 6.49% for angles, and 6.05% for the unit cell volume. To validate the performance of XRDElem-CNN, real diffraction patterns obtained from a conventional laboratory diffractometer (Cu K\\u03b1 wavelength) were employed. Various representations of atoms within the unit cell were proposed, which were computationally efficient for evaluation with the CNNs. The assessed lattice parameters by XRDElem-CNN were validated using the Lp-search method, showing agreement with the reported values.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Audio Super-Resolution (SR) is an important topic in the field of audio processing. Many models are designed in time domain due to the advantage of waveform processing, such as being able to avoid the phase problem. However, in prior works it is shown that Time-Domain Convolutional Neural Network (TD-CNN) approaches tend to produce annoying artifacts in their output. In order to confirm the source of the artifact, we conduct an AB listening test and found phase to be the cause. We further propose Time-Domain Phase Repair (TD-PR) to improve TD-CNNs' performance by repairing the phase of the TD-CNNs' output. In this paper, we focus on the music SR task, which is challenging due to the wide frequency response and dynamic range of music. Our proposed method can handle various narrow-bandwidth from 2.5kHz to 4kHz with a target bandwidth of 8kHz. We conduct both objective and subjective evaluation to assess the proposed method. The objective evaluation result indicates the proposed method achieves the SR task effectively. Moreover, the proposed TD-PR obtains the much higher mean opinion scores than all TD-CNN baselines, which indicates that the proposed TD-PR significantly improves perceptual quality. Samples are available on the demo page.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) has been proposed as a paradigm for performing machine learning with quantum processors where the training is efficient in the number of required runs of the quantum processor and takes place in the classical domain, avoiding the issue of barren plateaus in parameterized-circuit quantum neural networks. It is natural to consider using a quantum processor based on superconducting circuits to classify microwave signals that are analog -- continuous in time. However, while theoretical proposals of analog QRC exist, to date QRC has been implemented using circuit-model quantum systems -- imposing a discretization of the incoming signal in time, with each time point input by executing a gate operation. In this paper we show how a quantum superconducting circuit comprising an oscillator coupled to a qubit can be used as an analog quantum reservoir for a variety of classification tasks, achieving high accuracy on all of them. Our quantum system was operated without artificially discretizing the input data, directly taking in microwave signals. Our work does not attempt to address the question of whether QRCs could provide a quantum computational advantage in classifying pre-recorded classical signals. However, beyond illustrating that sophisticated tasks can be performed with a modest-size quantum system and inexpensive training, our work opens up the possibility of achieving a different kind of advantage than a purely computational advantage: superconducting circuits can act as extremely sensitive detectors of microwave photons; our work demonstrates processing of ultra-low-power microwave signals in our superconducting circuit, and by combining sensitive detection with QRC processing within the same system, one could achieve a quantum sensing-computational advantage, i.e., an advantage in the overall analysis of microwave signals comprising just a few photons.\",\n",

Most PCa patients in Oman are presented during the advanced stages of the disease with widespread metastatic disease reducing their overall rates of survival. Characterisation of the Omanis PCa population could be beneficial to develop a clinical profile demonstrating specific characteristics to better classify and derive radiomics signatures. These could help in developing artificial intelligence methods to assist with earlier and quicker diagnosis of possible prostate lesions. A retrospective, cross sectional study has been designed to determine the pathological and radiological characteristics based on multi sequence 3 dimensional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The MRI records are maintained within the existing electronic healthcare records of the Sultan Qaboos University Hospital Department of Radiology and Molecular Imaging. Data will be extracted based on a confirmed diagnosis reported between the 1st of January 2010 and October 2023. All patients included within the study will be aged between 18-99 years. A study specific data extraction template has been devised to gather demographic details, clinical parameters and radiological findings based on existing imaging reports within the HIS and PACS systems.

To address this, we propose using Sketch-based Profile Evolution (SPE) to detect network traffic anomalies. Firstly, the Traffic Graph (TG) of the network terminal is generated using Sketch to identify abnormal data flow positions. Next, the Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory Network (CNN-LSTM) are used to develop traffic behavior profiles, which are then continuously updated using Evolution to detect behavior pattern changes in real-time data streams. SPE allows for direct processing of raw traffic datasets and continuous detection of constantly updated data streams. In experiments using real network traffic datasets, the SPE algorithm was found to be far more efficient and accurate than PCA and Basic Evolution for outlier detection. It is important to note that the value of \\u03c6 can affect the results of anomaly detection.\",\n",

In this research, based on students' understanding of the current situation, AI is considered in relation to biomedical engineering, which is one of the interdisciplinary fields. Students expected the effectiveness of AI for society while having ethical and security concerns. Along with the increase in communication speed with large memory capacity and networking, many results have been obtained in the field of biomedical engineering: decoding DNA base sequences and digitizing medical images. On the other hand, security issues are being discussed in information networks: handling of personal genetic information. AI is expected to be used as a means of interdisciplinary communication: interdisciplinary participation is desirable. In the future, attitudes about using AI may become one of the main principles of human society.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"For intelligent surveillance systems, abnormal event detection (AED) automatically analyses monitoring video sequences and detects abnormal objects or strange human actions at the frame level. Due to the shortage of labelled data, most approaches for AED are based on reconstruction or prediction models in a semi-surprised manner. However, these methods may not generalize well to an unseen scene context. To address this, we present a pose-oriented scene-adaptive frame-work for AED. In this framework, we propose synergistic pose estimation and object detection, which integrates human poses and object detection information well to improve pose information accuracy. Subsequently, the enhanced pose sequences are taken into a spatial-temporal graph convolutional network to extract the geometric features. Finally, the features are embedded in a clustering layer to classify the type of actions and calculate the normality scores. For evaluation, the proposed framework is tested on video sequences with unseen scene context across from UCSD PED1 & PED2 and ShanghaiTech Campus datasets. The performance analysis and the results compared with other state-of-the-art works confirm the robustness and effectiveness of our proposed framework for cross-scene AED.\",\n",

Early traffic sign recognition methods were mostly based on color features, shape features, or multi feature fusion. Thanks to the rapid development of convolutional neural networks, traffic sign recognition methods based on deep learning have continuously made breakthroughs in both accuracy and speed. In this paper, focusing on the four major types of mainstream frameworks mentioned above, we will introduce the latest research progress in traffic sign detection and recognition technology, including the principles, steps, advantages and disadvantages of representative algorithms. In addition, we quantitatively compared the performance of different recognition methods on common data sets.

      "      \"abstract\": \": The term \\\"Medical Text summarization\\\" refers to the process of extracting or collecting more useful information from medical articles in a concise manner. Every day, the count of medical publications increases continuously, and applying text summarization techniques can minimize the time needed to manually transform medical papers into a summarized version. This study's goal is to present a summary of recent works in medical text summarization from 2018 to 2022. It includes 15 papers covering different methodologies such as Clinical Context-Aware (CCA), Prognosis Quality Recognition (PQR), Bidirectional Encoder Representations From Transformers (BERT), Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and Sequence-To-Sequence (seq-2-seq) model. Also, the paper describes the newest datasets (PubMed, arXiv, SUMPUBMED, Evidence-Based Medicine Summarization, COVID-19 Open Research, BioMed Central, Clinical Context-Aware, Biomedical Relation Extraction Dataset, Semantic Scholar Open Research Corpus, and Prognosis Quality Recognition) and evaluation metrics (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE), F1 Metric, Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU), BERTScore (BS), and Accuracy) used in medical text summarization.\",\n",

      "      \"title\": \"Temperature Forecasting for Iwo City, Nigeria Using Statistical Models and Selected Machine Learning Algorithms\",\n",
      "      \"abstract\": \"Time series modeling and forecasting using a machine learning algorithm approach for Iwo City, a western city in Nigeria, is a technique used to forecast the future occurrence of diverse data for the study. The purpose of this study is to use time series models and some machine learning approaches to predict the temperature in the future for climate change. The Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) Web service provided the information used in this study. The dataset underwent training and testing in an 80/20 per cent manner. Using seasonal auto-regressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) and twenty-four (24) different Machine Learning algorithms of regression performance of the temperature, future predictions of Iwo station, were made using training data that spans the years 1980 to 2012 and test data that spans the years 2013 to 2021. The results reveal that the standard deviation value ranges from 2.4\\u00d710-05 to 0.031, while the optimum model for the SARIMA (1, 0, 0) and Akaike\\u2019s Information Criterion (AIC) spans from 961.090 to 1341.831. Furthermore, the results of the statistical analysis show that the maximum average temperature recorded in April was 303.68K, the minimum temperature recorded in January was 293.23K with a maximum standard deviation of 1.84 in February, and the minimum standard deviation for the temperature was 0.42 in September. For the machine learning algorithm, Exponential GPR shows the highest R2 of 0.19 while the least Ensemble Boosted Trees (R2= -46.24). In terms of the forecasting performance of these machine learning algorithms based on RMSE, the best forecasting model was Medium Neural Network (RMSE = 1.8112). The result also reveals that Fine Gaussian gave the least MAE = 1.19, while the least MSE = 2.7534 meaning that these machine learning algorithms outperformed other models. As a result, the report recommends that Nigerian meteorological management establishes additional research centers to collect data and conduct research.\",\n",

Character names belong to the Culture Specific Items (CSIs) group known as proper names. As a CSI, names can contain historical and/or cultural references, which makes them difficult to translate. The study extracted the original names from the source text, Bakuten Shoot Beyblade, and compared them to their English version in the target text, Beyblade. The data collected were analyzed using the translation procedures proposed by Fernandes (2006) and Hervey Higgins (1992) to determine how the translation affects the movie. The analysis indicated that name translation in Beyblade mainly employed translation procedures of Recreation, Substitution, and Copy. They result in the loss of cultural reference and hidden meaning behind the names, affecting the story's intrinsic elements, particularly regarding the plot and characterization. The American audiences, therefore, are deprived of the opportunity to gain specific insights into the characters\\u2019 roles, relationships, and traits embedded in the character names of the original Bakuten Shoot Beyblade.\",\n",

However, as the difficulty of the target task increases and the model performance requirements progressively improve, these have to consume more communication costs to increase the model parameters. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes the Federated Learning with Sparsity and Quantization(FedSQ) method, where we select the gradients with a large rate of change in the gradients of the participants in each round for transmission, and utilize binary compression to quantize the selected model parameters, while adopting a suitable aggregation algorithm to replace the original FedAvg, so that it does not excessively impair the model accuracy in the case of high-fold compression. Finally, we verify the effectiveness of the scheme proposed in this paper, which can improve the quality of model training under model compression.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Pneumonia remains the most common reason for inpatient stays and fatalities among adults and children in the world. It became worse during Covid 19 pandemic. Most African countries like South Africa were and are still seriously affected. The situation is worse in rural areas because of several reasons, among them; not having enough X-rays machines, having no or few radiologists to analyze and interpret the X-ray pictures to determine if the pictures are normal pictures or pneumonia. The ability to accurately classify these two types of pneumonia can guarantee effective treatment which will boost survival chances. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a cost-effective approach and can play a pivotal role in easily analyzing and interpreting X-ray images. This research used CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining methodology in developing a simple Rest API model that would classify the chest X-ray image if it were normal, the person has pneumonia caused by bacteria or virus. Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model had a training accuracy of 73.89%, validation accuracy of 75.46%, and test accuracy of 75.46% whereas LeNet had 78.49%, 76.51%, and 76,51%, respectively. This study demonstrated to the public that AI models may be developed to aid health professionals in the early diagnosis, classification, analysis, and interpretation of X-ray images for pneumonia. In the future, the model created should convert the English interpretations into South African local languages like isiXhosa, Zulu, Venda, and many others. Thus, making it easier for the local communities to understand giving them a sense of belonging.\",\n",

Under these models, each node has an associated latent point in some (typically low-dimensional) geometric space, and network formation is driven by this unobserved geometric structure. The random dot product graph (RDPG) and its generalization (GRDPG) are latent space models under which this latent geometry is taken to be Euclidean. These latent vectors can be efficiently and accurately estimated using well-studied spectral embeddings. In this paper, we develop a minimax lower bound for estimating the latent positions in the RDPG and the GRDPG models under the two-to-infinity norm, and show that a particular spectral embedding method achieves this lower bound. We also derive a minimax lower bound for the related task of subspace estimation under the two-to-infinity norm that holds in general for low-rank plus noise network models, of which the RDPG and GRDPG are special cases. The lower bounds are achieved by a novel construction based on Hadamard matrices.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Understanding pedestrian route choice behavior in complex buildings is important to ensure pedestrian safety. Previous studies have mostly used traditional data collection methods and discrete choice modeling to understand the influence of different factors on pedestrian route and exit choice, particularly in simple indoor environments. However, research on pedestrian route choice in complex buildings is still limited. This paper presents a data-driven approach for understanding and predicting the pedestrian decision point choice during normal and emergency wayfinding in a multi-story building. For this, we first built an indoor network representation and proposed a data mapping technique to map VR coordinates to the indoor representation. We then used a well-established machine learning algorithm, namely the random forest (RF) model to predict pedestrian decision point choice along a route during four wayfinding tasks in a multi-story building. Pedestrian behavioral data in a multi-story building was collected by a Virtual Reality experiment. The results show a much higher prediction accuracy of decision points using the RF model (i.e., 93% on average) compared to the logistic regression model. The highest prediction accuracy was 96% for task 3. Additionally, we tested the model performance combining personal characteristics and we found that personal characteristics did not affect decision point choice. This paper demonstrates the potential of applying a machine learning algorithm to study pedestrian route choice behavior in complex indoor buildings.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The agricultural industry has the potential to meet the increasing food production requirements and supply nutritious and healthy food products. Since the Internet of Things (IoT) phenomenon has achieved considerable growth in recent years, IoT-based systems have been established for pest detection so as to mitigate the loss of crops and reduce serious damage by employing pesticides. In the event of pest attack, the detection of crop insects is a tedious process for farmers since a considerable proportion of crop yield is affected and the quality of pest detection is diminished. Based on morphological features, conventional insect detection is an option, although the process has a disadvantage, i.e., it necessitates highly trained taxonomists to accurately recognize the insects. In recent times, automated detection of insect categories has become a complex problem and has gained considerable interest since it is mainly carried out by agriculture specialists. Advanced technologies in deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) domains have effectively reached optimum performance in terms of pest detection and classification. Therefore, the current research article focuses on the design of the improved artificial-ecosystem-based optimizer with deep-learning-based insect detection and classification (IAEODL-IDC) technique in IoT-based agricultural sector. The purpose of the proposed IAEODL-IDC technique lies in the effectual identification and classification of different types of insects. In order to accomplish this objective, IoT-based sensors are used to capture the images from the agricultural environment. In addition to this, the proposed IAEODL-IDC method applies the median filtering (MF)-based noise removal process. The IAEODL-IDC technique uses the MobileNetv2 approach as well as for feature vector generation. The IAEO system is utilized for optimal hyperparameter tuning of the MobileNetv2 approach. Furthermore, the gated recurrent unit (GRU) methodology is exploited for effective recognition and classification of insects. An extensive range of simulations were conducted to exhibit the improved performance of the proposed IAEODL-IDC methodology. The simulation results validated the remarkable results of the IAEODL-IDC algorithm with recent systems.\",\n",

A feature extraction method is used to explore the application of graphic elements in digital effects films and television. Color features were extracted using the color histogram and color moments, the texture was extracted using the CLBP algorithm, and EEG signals were extracted using the CSP method. After analysis, it is concluded that as the film and TV timeline progresses, the value of RGB of color increases from (10,200) to (30,250), and the hue becomes heavier to pave the way for the restless and negative emotions later. The primary effects of graphical emotions were significantly smaller than 0.05 and were capable of causing emotional changes.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Interturn short circuit fault of distribution transformer winding occurs frequently and is difficult to accurately real-time monitoring, which seriously affects the reliability of the distribution network power supply. Therefore, the identification method of interturn short circuit faults for distribution transformers based on power loss variation is proposed to realize the online monitoring of winding interturn short circuit faults and early warning of insulation deterioration. First, the \\u201cfield-circuit\\u201d coupling three-dimensional simulation model is established as consistent with the actual transformer. On the premise of verifying the reliability and accuracy of the model, the variation characteristics of each physical quantity are simulated and analyzed when a single-turn short circuit occurs in different positions in the secondary side inner and outer winding of the distribution transformer. The winding power loss with the most significant change rate and easy to detect is obtained as the sensitive state variable. Then, by changing the winding interturn insulation resistance and the number of short-circuit turns, the gradual altering process of interturn insulation deterioration is simulated, and the variation law of winding current and power loss in the main circuit is explored. Moreover, the relationship between the interturn insulation state and influence factors including the critical resistance value of interturn insulation deterioration and insulation collapse, the power loss rate of change is analyzed. Finally, a method of interturn short circuit's fault identification of distribution transformer is proposed, which can diagnose the interturn insulation state of transformer winding in real-time and predict the interturn short-circuit fault.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Edge computing is a game changer for IoT, as it allows IoT devices to independently process and analyze data instead of just sending it to the cloud. But managing this considerable number of devices and deploying workloads on them in a coordinated and intelligent manner remains a challenge nowadays. In this paper, we focus on introducing the resilience dimension into these deployments, and we provide two main contributions: the use of federated machine learning techniques to develop a collaborative tool between the different devices aimed at detecting the possibility of a device failure, and subsequently, the utilization of the inferred information to optimize deployment plans ensuring the resilience in the devices. These two advances are implemented in an intelligent system, Akats, whose architecture is described in detail in this article. Finally, an application scenario is presented, based on Industry 4.0 - Machine predictive maintenance, to exemplify the benefits of the proposed intelligent system.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The management of wastewater is a significant global concern that calls for innovative solutions to lessen its negative effects on the environment. Conventional techniques of treating wastewater need improvement in order to deal with newly discovered contaminants, which highlights the importance of providing precise estimates of process performance and resource requirements. The worsening water shortage situation requires a paradigm shift in which wastewater is viewed as a useful resource. It is possible to create an economy that is both sustainable and circular by treating and recycling wastewater, putting less pressure on freshwater supplies, and leaving as little of an environmental footprint as possible. This study investigates the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) as software estimators in the treatment of wastewater, with a particular emphasis on predicting ammonium concentrations in effluent. In order to deal with imbalanced time-series data, the research introduces innovative data pretreatment strategies. These techniques include a Sliding Window protocol, Data Normalization, and a K-Fold training scheme. This illustrates the potential of ANNs to revolutionize wastewater treatment procedures and drive developments in this field. The suggested method demonstrates higher performance when estimating pollutant concentrations, showing the ability of ANNs to do so.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"ABSTRACT We have radiocarbon-dated the main settlement of Skarkos (Skarkos II) on the Cycladic island of Ios, using a set of animal bone samples. The site of Skarkos stands on a hill in a coastal plain, mid-way down the western side of Ios island and about 1 km from the island\\u2019s harbour. It is the first time this important settlement with a wealth of finds and an extraordinary building system with two-storey houses is dated in absolute terms complementing the chronology of the Cycladic EBA II period. The radiocarbon determinations show that the major phase of the settlement came to an end between circa 2550 and circa 2500 BC. The dates also confirm the archaeological evidence that the main occupation period is dated archaeologically to the EC II period (Keros-Syros culture). Furthermore, in order to embed the new Skarkos dates within the overall Cycladic chronology and define better the end of the EC II phase, we treated the Skarkos dates together with published dates from other Cycladic sites using Bayesian analysis considering two different models.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"\\n Unsupervised machine learning methods are gaining attention in the seismological community as more and larger datasets of continuous waveforms are collected. Recently, contrastive learning for unsupervised feature learning has shown great success in the field of computer vision and other domains, and we aim to transfer these methods to the domain of seismology. Contrastive learning algorithms use data augmentation to implement an instance-level discrimination task: The feature representations of two augmented versions of the same data example are trained to be similar, when at the same time dissimilar to other data examples. In particular, we use the popular contrastive learning method SimCLR. We test data augmentation strategies varying amplitude and frequency of seismological signals, and apply contrastive learning methods to automatically learn features. We use a dataset containing various mostly cryogenic waveforms detected by an STA/LTA short-term average/long-term average algorithm on continuous waveform recordings from the geophysical observatory at Neumayer station, Antarctica. The quality of the features is evaluated on a hand-labeled dataset that includes icequakes, earthquakes, and spikes, and on a larger unlabeled dataset using a classical clustering method, k-means. Results show that the approach separates the different hand-labeled groups with an accuracy of up to 88% and separates meaningful groups within the unlabeled data. Thus, we provide an effective tool for the unsupervised exploration of large seismological datasets and the automated compilation of event catalogs.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"With the development and construction of new power systems, the power grid structure is becoming increasingly interconnected, and the issue of short-circuiting currents in UHV systems will gradually manifest over the next five years. Existing measures for short-circuit current control typically involve using standby units, lines, and main transformers. However, conventional measures are gradually unable to meet the control requirements, necessitating strict control of the network topology during the planning phase and the exploration of new technologies and methods to keep pace with the evolving era. This paper studies the maximum outgoing line count of 750 kV substations, providing theoretical references applicable to practical operations for planning departments. A conceptual method based on fast-switching technology to suppress the current during a short circuit at the 750 kV voltage level is proposed, establishing the groundwork for the practical implementation of high-speed switching technology in the 750 kV voltage-level power grid.\",\n",

In recent years, deep learning models have shown high performance in detecting Type-3 and Type-4 code clones, and received increasing attention from the research community. However, compared with the attention given to the model design by the researchers, there is little research work on the quality of the datasets and the evaluation methodology (the way of dividing the dataset into training set and test set), which poses a challenge to the credibility of deep learning models.In this paper, we conduct experiments to evaluate the performance of the existing state-of-the-art models in multi-perspectives. At the same time, we release two new datasets for code clone detection, namely ConBigCloneBench and Google-CodeJam2 based on the existing datasets BigCloneBench and GoogleCodeJam, respectively. Our experiments show that the performance of the same model decreases up to 0.5 F1 score (from 0.9 to 0.4) on different evaluation perspectives and datasets, and the performance of some models is only similar to the simple MLP model. We analyze reasons for the performance decline further, and provide suggestions for future research to improve the performance of deep learning models from multi-perspectives.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"In order to further break through the invisibility and robustness of the 3D model multi-carrier information hiding algorithm, this paper proposes a multi-carrier information hiding algorithm based on point cloud convex hull fusion. First of all, in order to make the surface features of the fused point cloud model more obvious, the point cloud model is fused by convex hull center point fusion. Secondly, based on the Morse theory, the points of the fusion state model are classified, and the robust minimum points and multi-saddle points are obtained. Finally, the double embedding of the secret information is completed by slightly modifying the RGB channel strength at a specific point, which ensures the integrity of the secret information. The experimental data prove that the invisibility of the algorithm have been improved to a certain extent, and the robustness of the algorithm is relatively high in the face of attacks such as clipping, random noise addition, and simplification. The algorithm in this paper provides a new direction for information hiding based on 3D models.\",\n",

Contrasting various image databases, lr, \\u00b5 and other different parameters reveals that MOON outperforms other federal learning algorithms in all aspects such as learning accuracy, convergence speed and training time.

A combination of machine learning and computer vision techniques are generally used to address these situations. In this paper, we demonstrate a workflow using quantum-enhanced, transfer and classical machine learning to detect and localize aerospace vehicles and compute parameters such as range and altitude from color histograms. Additionally, we describe a data synthesis approach for training machine learning algorithms against aerospace imagery. The purpose of our study is not to present the superiority of a technique but rather the feasibility and practicality of incorporating quantum enhancement in aerospace data analytics, data synthesis through simulation programs, and parametric computations through color histograms.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The Mar Menor is a coastal lagoon of great socio-ecological and environmental value; in recent years, different localized episodes of hypoxia and eutrophication have modified the quality of its waters. The episodes are due to a drop in dissolved oxygen levels below 4 mg/L in some parts of the lagoon and a rise in chlorophyll a to over 1.8 mg/L. Considering that monitoring the Mar Menor and its watershed is essential to understand the environmental dynamics that cause these dramatic episodes, in recent years, efforts have focused on carrying out periodic measurements of different biophysical parameters of the water. Taking advantage of the data collected and the versatility offered by neural networks, this paper evaluates the performance of a dozen advanced neural networks oriented to time series forecasted for the estimation of dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll a parameters. The data used are obtained in the water body by means of sensors carried by a multiparameter oceanographic probe and two agro-climatic stations located near the Mar Menor. For the dissolved oxygen forecast, the models based on the Time2Vec architecture, accompanied by BiLSTM and Transformer, offer an R2 greater than 0.95. In the case of chlorophyll a, three models offer an R2 above 0.92. These metrics are corroborated by forecasting these two parameters for the first time step out of the data set used. Given the satisfactory results obtained, this work is integrated as a new biophysical parameter forecast component in the monitoring platform of the Mar Menor Observatory developed by IMIDA. The results demonstrate that it is feasible to forecast the concentration of chlorophyll a and dissolved oxygen using neural networks specialized in time series forecasts.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Lithium\\u2013sulfur (Li\\u2013S) batteries are attracting tremendous attention owing to their critical advantages, such as high theoretical capacity of sulfur, cost-effectiveness, and environment-friendliness. Nevertheless, the vast commercialisation of Li\\u2013S batteries is severely hindered by sharp capacity decay upon operation and shortened cycle life because of the insulating nature of sulfur along with the solubility of intermediate redox products, lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), in electrolytes. This work proposes the use of multifunctional Ni/NiO-embedded carbon nanofibers (Ni/NiO@CNFs) synthesized by an electrospinning technique with the corresponding heat treatment as promising free-standing current collectors to enhance the kinetics of LiPS redox reactions and to provide prolonged cyclability by utilizing more efficient active materials. The electrochemical performance of the Li\\u2013S batteries with Ni/NiO@CNFs with \\u223c2.0 mg cm\\u22122 sulfur loading at 0.5 and 1.0C current densities delivered initial specific capacities of 1335.1 mA h g\\u22121 and 1190.4 mA h g\\u22121, retrieving high-capacity retention of 77% and 70% after 100 and 200 cycles, respectively. The outcomes of this work disclose the beneficial auxiliary effect of metal and metal oxide nanoparticle embedment onto carbon nanofiber mats as being attractively suited up to achieve high-performance Li\\u2013S batteries.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Adversarial training (AT) is a prominent technique employed by deep learning models to defend against adversarial attacks, and to some extent, enhance model robustness. However, there are three main drawbacks of the existing AT-based defense methods: expensive computational cost, low generalization ability, and the dilemma between the original model and the defense model. To this end, we propose a novel benchmark called meta adversarial defense (MAD). The MAD benchmark consists of two MAD datasets, along with a MAD evaluation protocol. The two large-scale MAD datasets were generated through experiments using 30 kinds of attacks on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. In addition, we introduce a meta-learning based adversarial training (Meta-AT) algorithm as the baseline, which features high robustness to unseen adversarial attacks through few-shot learning. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our Meta-AT algorithm compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the model after Meta-AT maintains a relatively high clean-samples classification accuracy (CCA). It is worth noting that Meta-AT addresses all three aforementioned limitations, leading to substantial improvements. This benchmark ultimately achieved breakthroughs in investigating the transferability of adversarial defense methods to new attacks and the ability to learn from a limited number of adversarial examples. Our codes and attacked datasets address will be available at https://github.com/PXX1110/Meta_AT.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Sentiment analysis (SA) is a mechanized strategy for finding and understanding the feelings depicted in text. Over the most recent decade, SA has altogether expanded in ubiquity in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) people group. Because of the inescapable utilization of social media and web stages, SA is presently urgent for firms to get client info and shape their promoting approach. The motivation behind this study is to utilize a deep learning-based way to deal with natural language process to give an exhaustive investigation of the opinion of sentiment of social media content. The technique then builds a comparable model that may be applied to replicate the relevant social process. In instance, by dynamically choosing the most significant phrase in the current state depending on the information presented, the network can effectively recognize the significant material that is always changing. This prompts the semantic comprehension of the total sentence toward the finish of each phase of the interaction. Besides, an absence of context oriented data will prompt an incorrect and muddled semantic portrayal of natural language on the grounds that relevant data is fundamental for that portrayal. In this paper, we take a gander at the unimodal and multimodal social network sentiment analysis algorithms and foster two models for text sentiment investigation and picture-text multimodal sentiment examination.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Federated learning (FL) can suffer from a communication bottleneck when deployed in mobile networks, limiting participating clients and deterring FL convergence. The impact of practical air interfaces with discrete modulations on FL has not previously been studied in depth. This paper proposes a new paradigm of flexible aggregation-based FL (F$^2$L) over orthogonal frequency division multiple-access (OFDMA) air interface, termed as ``OFDMA-F$^2$L'', allowing selected clients to train local models for various numbers of iterations before uploading the models in each aggregation round. We optimize the selections of clients, subchannels and modulations, adapting to channel conditions and computing powers. Specifically, we derive an upper bound on the optimality gap of OFDMA-F$^2$L capturing the impact of the selections, and show that the upper bound is minimized by maximizing the weighted sum rate of the clients per aggregation round. A Lagrange-dual based method is developed to solve this challenging mixed integer program of weighted sum rate maximization, revealing that a ``winner-takes-all'' policy provides the almost surely optimal client, subchannel, and modulation selections. Experiments on multilayer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks show that OFDMA-F$^2$L with optimal selections can significantly improve the training convergence and accuracy, e.g., by about 18\\\\% and 5\\\\%, compared to potential alternatives.\",\n",

Considering that most transformer problems are caused by heat losses due to the presence of harmonics, it was decided to use a numerical method with the highest accuracy, finite element method (FEM) to analyze the hot spot temperature (HST) of the thermal distribution transformer model. Through the use of COMSOL Multiphysics software, three phases of unbalanced harmonic loads are considered, which contribute to three different total harmonic distortion current (THDI) levels and five different insulation temperature classes. Using the IEEE C57.110-2018 guidance, the simulation outputs are then verified with HST results from the HST mathematical model. The findings indicated that with the increased loadings, the unbalanced harmonic currents have impacted the HST increment and distinguished the HST values between the phases.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The confidentiality of the operating system kernel addresses is crucial to keeping the kernel secure from malicious users. To avoid leaking this position, researchers have proposed various techniques to defeat the exploits of abnormal data flows embedded in the kernel's memory safety loopholes, such as uninitialized memory read and buffer over-reads. However, this is far from complete. The kernel address can be leaked even in normal data flows without exploiting memory safety loopholes. We have designed a static analysis tool named Hawkeye to fill the gap. It searches for kernel address leakages in normal data flows that reveal the kernel address clues. Hawkeye precisely identifies the kernel addresses with minimum manual annotation and scales to analyze the whole kernel source code. It requires nearly ten times fewer memory resources and 40 times less inspection time than the state-of-the-art tool that analyzes kernel address leakage. Hawkeye unveils hundreds of leakages in various versioned kernels. It has even discovered 20 bugs in the mainline Linux kernel with the kernel pointer hashing mechanism already deployed and three bugs in FreeBSD. All the corresponding patches have been accepted by the developers.\",\n",

Four databases, including PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Scopus were searched for studies published from January 2016 to April 2021 evaluating the use of ML-based CDS in clinical settings. We extracted the study design, care setting, clinical task, CDS task, and ML method. The level of CDS autonomy was examined using a previously published 3-level classification based on the division of clinical tasks between the clinician and CDS; effects on decision-making, care delivery, and patient outcomes were summarized.\\n\\n\\nRESULTS\\nThirty-two studies evaluating the use of ML-based CDS in clinical settings were identified. All were undertaken in developed countries and largely in secondary and tertiary care settings. The most common clinical tasks supported by ML-based CDS were image recognition and interpretation (n\\u2009=\\u200912) and risk assessment (n\\u2009=\\u20099). The majority of studies examined assistive CDS (n\\u2009=\\u200923) which required clinicians to confirm or approve CDS recommendations for risk assessment in sepsis and for interpreting cancerous lesions in colonoscopy. Effects on decision-making, care delivery, and patient outcomes were mixed.\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\nML-based CDS are being evaluated in many clinical areas. There remain many opportunities to apply and evaluate effects of ML-based CDS on decision-making, care delivery, and patient outcomes, particularly in resource-constrained settings.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"6541 Background: Prostate cancer remains the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in men in the United States. BronxCare Health System (BCHS) serves the Bronx neighborhoods of Morris Heights, Fordham South, and Mount Hope, notable for the highest prostate cancer incidence rate in New York City as per the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network report 2019, highlighting the need for prostate cancer screening among the patient population we serve. An anonymous voluntary paper survey was performed in 2019 at BCHS to determine primary care physician understanding and implementation of current PSA testing guidelines. The study showed that primary care providers at BCHS approach PSA testing in a wide variety of ways and screen a wide age range of patients suggesting a need for intervention. An electronic medical record (EMR) decision support tool activated during primary care visits for men aged 55-69 years was implemented beginning January 1, 2021 which facilitates the provider and patient engagement in a shared decision-making discussion. This a follow-up study to determine the effect of this EMR application on PSA order rates and prostate cancer diagnosis rates at BCHS. Methods: The total number of patients who had PSA and lipid panel (LP) screening were extracted from the EMR of BCHS for potentially eligible men (aged 55-69) seen during primary care visits during the years 2016-2022. LP is done annually as a part of routine screening for adults aged 55-69 and is taken as an equivalent of primary care visits. PSA screening rates were compared to LP screening rates to control for unforeseen variables. Similarly, the number of newly-diagnosed prostate cancers among the same population of men was extracted for the years 2016-2021. Data for 2022 is still not available. 2016-2020 are pre-EMR and 2021 and 2022 are post-EMR flag years. The pre and post-EMR flag PSA and prostate cancer diagnosis numbers were compared by calculating Z scores and p-values. Results: The year-wise PSA, LP, and newly-diagnosed prostate cancers (PC) are tabulated below. The proportion of men who had PSA testing among all men aged 55-69 who had LP testing in each pre-EMR flag year was compared to each post-EMR flag year. A significant increase (p < 0.00001) was noted in the proportion of men who had PSA screening after implementation of the EMR application. Similarly, the proportion of men with newly-diagnosed prostate cancer among all men aged 55-69 who had PSA screening significantly increased after EMR application (p < 0.00001). Conclusions: A decision support tool embedded in the EMR has been an effective approach in increasing prostate cancer screening rates and may help curb prostate cancer mortality in our patient population as early detection in right men at the right age has the potential to reduce prostate cancer mortality.

Brain tumor is one of the deadliest diseases that affect CNS and they should be detected earlier to avoid serious health implications. As it is one of the most dangerous types of cancer, its diagnosis is a crucial part of the healthcare sector. A brain tumor can be malignant or benign and its grade recognition is a tedious task for the radiologist. In the recent past, researchers have proposed various automatic detection and classification techniques that use different imaging modalities focusing on increased accuracy. In this paper, we have done an in-depth study of 19 different trained deep learning models like Alexnet, VGGnet, DarkNet, DenseNet, ResNet, InceptionNet, ShuffleNet, NasNet and their variants for the detection of brain tumors using deep transfer learning. The performance parameters show that NASNet-Large is outperforming others with an accuracy of 98.03% for detection and 97.87% for classification. The thresholding algorithm is used for segmenting out the tumor region if the detected output is other than normal.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Humans have good natural intuition to recognize when another person has something to say. It would be interesting if an AI can also recognize intentions to speak. Especially in scenarios when an AI is guiding a group discussion, this can be a useful skill. This work studies the inference of successful and unsuccessful intentions to speak from accelerometer data. This is chosen because it is privacy-preserving and feasible for in-the-wild settings since it can be placed in a smart badge. Data from a real-life social networking event is used to train a machine-learning model that aims to infer intentions to speak. A subset of unsuccessful intention-to-speak cases in the data is annotated. The model is trained on the successful intentions to speak and evaluated on both the successful and unsuccessful cases. In conclusion, there is useful information in accelerometer data, but not enough to reliably capture intentions to speak. For example, posture shifts are correlated with intentions to speak, but people also often shift posture without having an intention to speak, or have an intention to speak without shifting their posture. More modalities are likely needed to reliably infer intentions to speak.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Joint source-channel coding schemes based on deep neural networks (DeepJSCC) have recently achieved remarkable performance for wireless image transmission. However, these methods usually focus only on the distortion of the reconstructed signal at the receiver side with respect to the source at the transmitter side, rather than the perceptual quality of the reconstruction which carries more semantic information. As a result, severe perceptual distortion can be introduced under extreme conditions such as low bandwidth and low signal-to-noise ratio. In this work, we propose CommIN, which views the recovery of high-quality source images from degraded reconstructions as an inverse problem. To address this, CommIN combines Invertible Neural Networks (INN) with diffusion models, aiming for superior perceptual quality. Through experiments, we show that our CommIN significantly improves the perceptual quality compared to DeepJSCC under extreme conditions and outperforms other inverse problem approaches used in DeepJSCC.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Convolutional neural networks play a very important role in computer vision, such as image classification, image segmentation, and handwriting recognition have been widely used. In daily life, this technology is used in the photo recognition of e-commerce platforms. However, the timing of the identification process grows into a major problem. Therefore, it is particularly important to reduce the recognition time by optimizing the deep learning model. To solve this problem, two experimental methods are proposed to optimize the volume of the convolutional neural network model. The first is to reduce the size of the model by scaling down the convolutional kernel. The second is to prune the model with L-1 norm to reduce the size of the model and improve the running speed. According to the experimental results, the two experimental methods have achieved remarkable optimization effects. In the first experiment, the method of scaling down convolutional kernel has an important optimization effect for training the deep learning model of small data sets. In another experiment using L-1 pruning algorithm greatly improves the running speed of models by reducing the size of models. To sum up, the optimization method proposed above for the convolutional neural network model on the mobile end can be applied in the field that requires a large amount of image classification, such as delivery package sorting. At the same time, to better improve the performance of the model, it will become feasible to use a variety of optimization methods to tune it.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Model predictive control (MPC) is a cutting-edge control technique, but its susceptibility to inaccuracies in the model remains a challenge for embedded systems. In this study, we propose a data-driven MPC framework to address this issue and achieve robust and adaptable performance. Our framework involves systematically identifying system dynamics and learning the MPC policy through function approximations. Specifically, we introduce a system identification method based on the Deep neural network (DNN) and integrate it with MPC. The function approximation capability of DNN enables the controller to learn the nonlinear dynamics of the system then the MPC policy is established based on the identified model. Also, through an added control term the robustness and convergence of the closed-loop system are guaranteed. Then the governing equation of a non-local strain gradient (NSG) nano-beam is presented. Finally, the proposed control scheme is used for vibration suppression in the NSG nano-beam. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, the controller is applied to the unknown system, meaning that solely during the training phase of the neural state-space-based model we relied on the data extracted from the time history of the beam\\u2019s deflection. The simulation results conclusively demonstrate the remarkable performance of our proposed approach in effectively suppressing vibrations.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Energy is a fundamental human need for several activities. Energy can be impacted by several factors ranging from technical to social and environmental. The impact of COVID-19 outbreak on the energy sector is enormous with serious global socioeconomic disruptions affecting all economic sectors, including tourism, industry, higher education, and the electricity industry. Based on the unstructured data obtained from Eko Electricity Distribution Company this paper proposes three deep learning (DL) models namely: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Simple Recurrent Neural Network (SimpleRNN), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) were used to analyse the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on energy consumption and predict future energy consumption in various district in Lagos, Nigeria. The models were evaluated using the following performance metrics namely: Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). On overall, the lowest MAPE, MAE, RMSE, and MSE of 0.120, 71.073, 93.981, and 8832.466 were obtained for LSTM in Orile, SRNN in Ijora, and GRU in Ijora, respectively. Generally, the GRU performed better in predicting energy consumption in most of the districts of the case study than the LSTM and SimpleRNN. Hence, GRU model can be considered the optimal model for energy consumption prediction in the case study. The importance of having this model is that it can help the government and other stakeholders in economic planning of electricity distribution networks.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Walking detection in the daily life of patients with Parkinson\\u2019s disease (PD) is of great significance for tracking the progress of the disease. This study aims to implement an accurate, objective, and passive detection algorithm optimized based on an interpretable deep learning architecture for the daily walking of patients with PD and to explore the most representative spatiotemporal motor features. Five inertial measurement units attached to the wrist, ankle, and waist are used to collect motion data from 100 subjects during a 10-meter walking test. The raw data of each sensor are subjected to the continuous wavelet transform to train the classification model of the constructed 6-channel convolutional neural network (CNN). The results show that the sensor located at the waist has the best classification performance with an accuracy of 98.01%\\u00b10.85% and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.9981\\u00b10.0017 under ten-fold cross-validation. The gradient-weighted class activation mapping shows that the feature points with greater contribution to PD were concentrated in the lower frequency band (0.5~3Hz) compared with healthy controls. The visual maps of the 3D CNN show that only three out of the six time series have a greater contribution, which is used as a basis to further optimize the model input, greatly reducing the raw data processing costs (50%) while ensuring its performance (AUC=0.9929\\u00b10.0019). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to consider the visual interpretation-based optimization of an intelligent classification model in the intelligent diagnosis of PD.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The development of cloud computing technology and big data comprises more users to store their data in the cloud server. The increases in the data volume and storage are subjected to the increased risk of data access with unauthorized users. Traditionally, to improve data authorization the cloud data is encrypted before uploading to the server. To improve cloud authentication Single Factor Authentication (SFA) techniques are evolved. However, conventional SFA is not efficient for sensitive information that is able to be accessed by third parties. To overcome this limitation, this research proposes a Single-factor Samoa Substring Escrow Cryptography scheme (SSS-EC). The proposed SSS-EC model uses fingerprint biometric data for authentication in cloud data. Initially, Samoa Substring is implemented with the validation of the client single-factor i.e fingerprint data. The validated information is stored in the cloud escrow. The validated data is encrypted using homomorphic encryption. The encrypted data is accessed with the attribute structure those need to query and decrypt the data in the Samoa Substring. Upon the verification of the attribute i.e., fingerprint, cipher text based on Samoa Sub-String is shared between the owner and user without any keyword. The verification with the cipher text is performed with Elliptical Curve Cryptography (ECC). The implementation of the SSS-EC scheme improves authentication in the cloud. Finally, the Machine Learning (ML) method is implemented for the classification of the different attacks in the cloud server using CICIDS dataset. The simulation analysis of the proposed SSS-EC model with the existing authentication techniques such as Ring Learning with Errors (R-LWE) and Identity Concealed Authentication Scheme (ICAS) based on two factors is performed. The proposed SSS-EC exhibits higher authentication accuracy and reduced computational cost for the different users and cloud servers. The experimental results confirmed that the proposed SSS-EC scheme improves authentication with state-of-the-art techniques.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Non-linear optical microscopy techniques (NLO), which exploit processes upon which a sample emits light in the visible when excited with infrared photons [1], have attracted important attention to date. Among these, Second Harmonic Generation Microscopy (SHG) and Two-Photon Excited Fluorescence Microscopy (TPEF) have been demonstrated as powerful tools for the 3D visualization of tissues and advanced materials. Here we discuss two architectures for super-resolved non-linear optical microscopy. First, we present how the contrast mechanisms of SHG and TPEF imaging can be harnessed to provide resolutions beyond the diffraction barrier, when combined with the re-scan concept, previously introduced in the context of re-scan confocal microscopy [2]. Considering the current high need for techniques capable to characterize non-fluorescent samples at sub-diffraction resolution, we place special focus on showcasing the resolution advantage of Re-Scan Second Harmonic Generation Microscopy (rSHG) [3]. Second, we turn our attention to super-resolved non-linear optical microscopy based on image scanning microscopy concepts [4],[5]. In the final part we discuss perspectives on combining super-resolved NLO imaging with trending artificial intelligence methods. In this context, we first discuss avenues that we are exploring for virtual super-resolved NLO based on Generative Adversarial Networks, and then switch focus towards automated diagnostics perspectives building on the combined use of complementary Deep Learning models [6].\",\n",

The measurements were collected using the Vaisala Forward Scatter Sensor model FD70 and Weather Transmitter model WXT50, and Gill R3A ultrasonic anemometer mounted on the Research Vessel Atlantic Condor. To perform nowcasting, the time series of fog visibility (Vis), wind speed, dew point depression, and relative humidity with respect to water were preprocessed to have lagged time step features. Generative nowcasting of Vis time series for lead times of 30 and 60 minutes were performed using conditional generative adversarial networks (cGAN) regression at visibility thresholds of Vis<1 km and<10 km. Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) was used as a baseline method for comparison against cGAN. At the 30 min lead time, Vis was best predicted with cGAN at Vis<1 km (RMSE = 0.151 km) and with XGBoost at Vis<10 km (RMSE = 2.821 km). At the 60 min lead time, Vis was best predicted with XGBoost at Vis<1 km (RMSE = 0.167 km) and Vis<10 km (RMSE = 3.508 km), but the cGAN RMSE was similar to XGBoost. Despite nowcasting Vis at 30 min being quite difficult, the ability of the cGAN model to track the variation in Vis at 1 km suggests that there is potential for generative analysis of marine fog visibility using observational meteorological parameters.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"In this work, we propose a method for trajectory implementation based on the Learning by Demonstrations approach to deal with trajectory planning issues in upper-limb rehabilitation exoskeletons. Currently applied path-planning methods use mathematical trajectories or Teach-and-play approaches. The former do not propose human-like movements to patients, which is crucial to induce correct motor relearning. Moreover, they often differ from therapists' expectations of how movements should be executed, reducing the acceptability and use of exoskeletons in hospitals. The latter, using a single filtered trajectory demonstration, better meet therapists' expectations but lack consistency and optimization. In our approach, we employed Hidden Markov Models, still never used for rehabilitation robotics, to study a set of demonstrations and we optimized the results to respect physiological muscular activation patterns. Recorded few repetitions of a movement from the interaction of a therapist with an exoskeleton, our machine-learning-based algorithm returns a ready-to-use trajectory representing the therapist's desires. We tested our method on a 4 degrees-of-freedom exoskeleton to record 5 exercises, interacting with 5 therapists. Comparing our trajectories with those obtained with literature methods, we see that our approach produces better kinematic and human-likeness results, and is better according to the global opinion expressed by the therapists.\",\n",

Instructors and educational decision-makers heavily rely on predicting student performance to customize instruction based on individual needs. With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, distance learning has become the primary method of education worldwide, making it essential for Higher Education Institutions to accurately predict student performance in this context. To achieve this, this research conducted a literature review to identify effective factors influencing student performance during distance learning. It also aimed to establish a suitable definition of student performance in this setting by exploring new concepts and attributes. Additionally, the research aimed to develop a prediction model for student performance during distance learning, incorporating the newly defined factors. The proposed data-driven model was empirically validated, and the results demonstrated the superiority of our approach, particularly in terms of the student performance definition and the machine learning-based technique used for prediction.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The specialisation of agricultural systems in Western Europe and the intensification of livestock and cropping production are intrinsically linked to substantial resource inputs. This intensified approach frequently leads to nutrient surpluses and biodiversity loss, resulting in detrimental environmental impacts. A transformative agricultural shift is imperative in light of climate and environmental protection objectives. Addressing this need, the Lindhof eco\\u2010efficient pasture\\u2010based milk production initiative, initiated in 2016, is a tangible manifestation of a productive and profitable dairy system integrated within a ley\\u2010based Integrated Crop\\u2010Livestock System (ICLS). Operational at the organically managed Lindhof farm, this approach involves a rotational stocking system of spring\\u2010calving Jersey cows stocked on grass\\u2010clover\\u2010herb leys embedded within a cash crop rotation. The dairy cows benefit from these highly productive swards, rich in nutritive value comparable to concentrate feeding. At the same time, the cultivated crops derive advantages from the legacy effect of leys due to nutrient exchange facilitated by grazing excreta and residual crop matter. Compared to specialised systems, the ley\\u2010based ICLS emerges as an alternative dairy production paradigm that supports many ecosystem services \\u2013 including minimised nutrient losses, a lower carbon footprint and positive contributions to agro\\u2010biodiversity. These outcomes are realised without compromising overall land\\u2010use efficiency while reducing environmental and social costs of 20\\u201330 Eurocent per kg of milk produced compared to specialised systems. Thus, the ley\\u2010based ICLS conforms to the principles of ecological intensification, enhancing functional diversity within the agricultural landscape. Essentially, the Lindhof initiative represents a holistic and environmentally responsible approach to farming that could contribute to realising the EU Farm to Fork Strategy.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Advanced sensors for control, safety, monitoring, perception, and operation are becoming more necessary as the automobile industry undergoes rapid transformation. As computing power increases, automobiles increasingly imitate mobile computers. The quality of the roads has a significant role in determining the cost and security of transportation. In order for agencies to conduct timely repairs and maintain ideal road conditions, damage identification is a crucial duty for road maintenance. Road quality is being monitored using a variety of image and video monitoring techniques. Manually assessing and analyse incoming information may be a time-consuming process. Thus, it is important to use computer vision and deep learning methods to enhance the processes for inspecting and assessing the status of control objects. Researches have rapidly adopted object detection/classification deep learning models for road damage detection thanks to the rapid advancement of deep learning methods in recent years. Municipalities may save resources and time by using automated road damage detecting technologies. This research suggests using a CNN trained on a freshly curated dataset of road damage data from Saudi Arabia to identify the degree of road damage. Cracks, potholes, depressions, and shove are the four classified classifications presented in this study's dataset. Experts analyzed data that was obtained with the help of maintenance workers, volunteer in the city of Coimbatore using smartphones. More than one deep learning algorithm was also deployed and tested on the suggested dataset. The research shown that the suggested custom CNN (RoadNet) outperformed the per-trained models in terms of accuracy.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"With the increasingly complex electromagnetic influence in the modern communication environment and the explosive growth of communication business data, the modulation recognition system needs to constantly learn new modulation categories and signal characteristics in the process of data increment, and gradually acquire stronger modulation recognition capability. This paper proposes a communication modulation signal recognition method based on multi-entropy and artificial intelligence technology. Firstly, the power entropy, singular spectral entropy, sample entropy, fuzzy entropy, and permutation entropy of the signal are calculated, and a composite entropy feature calculation method based on entropy weight method is proposed to further study the feature extraction of the signal. Finally, it is found that when using neural network for learning, without feature extraction, the recognition accuracy rate is only 70.7%, while using the feature extraction method proposed in this paper, the accuracy rate can reach 89.5%, and the recognition speed is significantly improved. In addition, the feature extraction method proposed in this paper can improve all kinds of modulation recognition based on artificial intelligence.\",\n",

While the significant effects of the porosity and the pore morphology on the fatigue behavior of PM components have been widely investigated, their numerical prediction during PM process has rarely been performed. In this work, a multiscale model of powder compaction of Astaloy 85Mo is presented, which provides information on both density distribution and pore morphology. A modified Drucker-Prager model and a friction model were experimentally derived to simulate the compaction process for different tool steels on macroscale, providing information on the density distribution. Using machine learning, artificial microstructural images of the powder compact were generated depending on local density. Both models were combined and applied to the compaction of a gear, which delivered promising results that agree well with experiments.\",\n",

It's not just sustenance; the rice industry is a major force, providing employment to 1.8 million individuals, directly and indirectly, from diligent farmers to traders and retailers. This sector significantly contributes to government revenue through taxes and exports, with 10% of rice production being exported, bolstering foreign exchange earnings. Moreover, rural households rely on rice for income, uplifting living standards and fighting poverty. However, the existing methods for disease detection, rice quality prediction, and soil quality assessment are often slow and subjective. This research advocates the use of cutting-edge deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to tackle these challenges.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) provide an energy-efficient deep learning option due to their unique spike-based event-driven (i.e., spike-driven) paradigm. In this paper, we incorporate the spike-driven paradigm into Transformer by the proposed Spike-driven Transformer with four unique properties: 1) Event-driven, no calculation is triggered when the input of Transformer is zero; 2) Binary spike communication, all matrix multiplications associated with the spike matrix can be transformed into sparse additions; 3) Self-attention with linear complexity at both token and channel dimensions; 4) The operations between spike-form Query, Key, and Value are mask and addition. Together, there are only sparse addition operations in the Spike-driven Transformer. To this end, we design a novel Spike-Driven Self-Attention (SDSA), which exploits only mask and addition operations without any multiplication, and thus having up to $87.2\\\\times$ lower computation energy than vanilla self-attention. Especially in SDSA, the matrix multiplication between Query, Key, and Value is designed as the mask operation. In addition, we rearrange all residual connections in the vanilla Transformer before the activation functions to ensure that all neurons transmit binary spike signals. It is shown that the Spike-driven Transformer can achieve 77.1\\\\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, which is the state-of-the-art result in the SNN field.

      "      \"abstract\": \"Due to a lack of transparency, supply chain management regularly experienced problems such service redundancy, insufficient departmental coordination, and a lack of standardization .These days, product counterfeiting is a highly common occurrence, and it is nearly impossible to identify a counterfeit goods by its appearance alone. For reputable businesses, counterfeiters pose serious problems, yet the full impact of counterfeit goods on brands is too often unknown. Several strategies have been developed in the past to deal with the issue of product counterfeiting.The most widely used techniques include the use of QR code-based systems, artificial intelligence, and RFID tags. However, there were a few drawbacks to each of them artificial intelligence employs CNN and machine learning, which require a lot of processing power a QR code can be duplicated from a real product and placed on a false one, and so on.\\nThe goal of this research is to enhance the identification of counterfeit goods by tracing their supply chain's past. Blockchain technology, which guarantees the identification and traceability of genuine products across the supply chain, makes this possible. With a blockchain-based system, several parties can access everything simultaneously and it becomes decentralized. One of its key benefits is that the recorded data is very safe and protected from any vulnerabilities because it is hard to alter without the agreement of all parties involved. This study describes a system for detecting counterfeit goods that uses blockchain technology.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Background Dengue, Zika, and chikungunya, whose viruses are transmitted mainly by Aedes aegypti, significantly impact human health worldwide. Despite the recent development of promising vaccines against the dengue virus, controlling these arbovirus diseases still depends on mosquito surveillance and control. Nonetheless, several studies have shown that these measures are not sufficiently effective or ineffective. Identifying higher-risk areas in a municipality and directing control efforts towards them could improve it. One tool for this is the premise condition index (PCI); however, its measure requires visiting all buildings. We propose a novel approach capable of predicting the PCI based on facade street-level images, which we call PCINet. Methodology Our study was conducted in Campinas, a one million-inhabitant city in S{small tilde}ao Paulo, Brazil. We surveyed 200 blocks, visited their buildings, and measured the three traditional PCI components (building and backyard conditions and shading), the facade conditions (taking pictures of them), and other characteristics. We trained a deep neural network with the pictures taken, creating a computational model that can predict buildings conditions based on the view of their facades. We evaluated PCINet in a scenario emulating a real large-scale situation, where the model could be deployed to automatically monitor four regions of Campinas to identify risk areas. Principal findings PCINet produced reasonable results in differentiating the facade condition into three levels, and it is a scalable strategy to triage large areas. The entire process can be automated through data collection from facade data sources and inferences through PCINet. The facade conditions correlated highly with the building and backyard conditions and reasonably well with shading and backyard conditions. The use of street-level images and PCINet could help to optimize Ae. aegypti surveillance and control, reducing the number of in-person visits necessary to identify buildings, blocks, and neighborhoods at higher risk from mosquito and arbovirus diseases.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Our research has identified a significant shift in the utilization of machine learning models for prediction and decision-making. Rather than solely relying on these models, there is now a growing focus on their explainability and interpretability. Data for this study were acquired between 2019 and 2022 in the Nigerian Coastal Plain, encompassing information from two thousand patients collected at secondary and tertiary healthcare centers, comprising fifteen distinct features. Our team utilized the Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) method to achieve this goal, adhering to the principle of fair play from game theory, giving every maternal attribute used in our work equal consideration. With an RF model and explainable AI techniques, we aimed to predict maternal outcomes and provide comprehensive insights into the most important features of mothers within the bearing age group. We summarized the study\\u2019s findings in terms of demography, laboratory results, physical examination, and mode of delivery. Our analysis revealed that mothers of an older age are more likely to experience a caesarean section or have a child with Down syndrome. However, we also found that the SHAP method, along with other XAI methods such as LIME and CIU, can play a vital role in improving satisfaction, time, and understanding. This approach can greatly improve medical decision-making, benefiting both mothers and their children. Our confidence in these findings is high, and we believe they will have a noteworthy impact on the field of parental health.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disorder. Early screening, particularly in blood plasma, has been demonstrated as a promising approach to the diagnosis and prevention of AD. In addition, metabolic dysfunction has been demonstrated to be closely related to AD, which might be reflected in the whole blood transcriptome. Hence, we hypothesized that the establishment of a diagnostic model based on the metabolic signatures of blood is a workable strategy. To that end, we initially constructed metabolic pathway pairwise (MPP) signatures to characterize the interplay among metabolic pathways. Then, a series of bioinformatic methodologies, e.g., differential expression analysis, functional enrichment analysis, network analysis, etc., were used to investigate the molecular mechanism behind AD. Moreover, an unsupervised clustering analysis based on the MPP signature profile via the Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) algorithm was utilized to stratify AD patients. Finally, aimed at distinguishing AD patients from non-AD groups, a metabolic pathway-pairwise scoring system (MPPSS) was established using multi-machine learning methods. As a result, many metabolic pathways correlated to AD were disclosed, including oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid biosynthesis, etc. NMF clustering analysis divided AD patients into two subgroups (S1 and S2), which exhibit distinct activities of metabolism and immunity. Typically, oxidative phosphorylation in S2 exhibits a lower activity than that in S1 and non-AD group, suggesting the patients in S2 might possess a more compromised brain metabolism. Additionally, immune infiltration analysis showed that the patients in S2 might have phenomena of immune suppression compared with S1 and the non-AD group. These findings indicated that S2 probably has a more severe progression of AD. Finally, MPPSS could achieve an AUC of 0.73 (95%CI: 0.70, 0.77) in the training dataset, 0.71 (95%CI: 0.65, 0.77) in the testing dataset, and an AUC of 0.99 (95%CI: 0.96, 1.00) in one external validation dataset. Overall, our study successfully established a novel metabolism-based scoring system for AD diagnosis using the blood transcriptome and provided new insight into the molecular mechanism of metabolic dysfunction implicated in AD.\",\n",

Deep learning models have recently been proven to be successful at stock market predictions. Traditional deep learning models, however, frequently disregard the hierarchical structure and temporal relationships of the stock market. Here, we introduce the StockTensor, a brand-new tensorized hierarchical graph attention network for stock market forecasting. StockTensor models the hierarchical structure of the stock market data by constructing a hierarchical graph of stocks. At each level of the hierarchy, StockTensor uses a graph attention network to learn the relationships between stocks and aggregate the information from neighboring stocks. StockTensor also models the temporal dependencies of the stock market data by using a recurrent neural network. The recurrent neural network learns to predict future stock prices based on the current stock prices and the historical stock prices. We evaluate StockTensor on two real-world stock market datasets. The results show that StockTensor outperforms several stateof-the-art stock market forecasting models.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The COVID-19 pandemic brought global disruptions to the way universities operate. Online learning abruptly took priority, as the physical campuses in Australian universities became deserted. Staff had to instantly adapt to major changes in work practices, whilst continuing to support students\\u2019 engagement and maintain quality teaching and learning. This article discusses how change fatigue during the pandemic impacted the wellbeing of staff working in the enabling education sector. As staff and student wellbeing is interdependent, gaining a better understanding of the influences on staff wellbeing in the post-pandemic era is worth exploring in the context of discussions around student wellbeing and success. Autoethnographical reflections of eight practitioners at six Australian universities working in teaching, leadership and professional practice in enabling education, were thematically analysed. Emergent data reveals the superordinate theme of change fatigue and sub-themes of time, online fatigue, and emotional labour. This article highlights the impact of workload intensification and change fatigue in educators. Our findings demonstrated that practitioners prioritise their workload and students, to the detriment of their own wellbeing. These findings hold relevance for institutions as they look to address student wellbeing and success, and highlights the value of embedding cultures of care and compassion across all levels of the university.\",\n",

Our methodology involves simulating proteins with molecular dynamics and utilizing the resulting trajectories to train a neural network potential through differentiable trajectory reweighting. Remarkably, this method requires only the native conformation of proteins, eliminating the need for labeled data derived from extensive simulations or memory-intensive end-to-end differentiable simulations. Once trained, the model can be employed to run parallel molecular dynamics simulations and sample folding events for proteins both within and beyond the training distribution, showcasing its extrapolation capabilities. By applying Markov state models, native-like conformations of the simulated proteins can be predicted from the coarse-grained simulations. Owing to its theoretical transferability and ability to use solely experimental static structures as training data, we anticipate that this approach will prove advantageous for developing new protein force fields and further advancing the study of protein dynamics, folding, and interactions.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), also referred to as the third generation of artificial neural networks, are highly prized for their biological realism, robustness, and low power requirements. SNNs are crucial in fields such as object detection, image recognition, etc. The classification of short text plays an significant role in the development of chatbots and intent detection. It is also an important task that is widely used in many downstream tasks. However, studies applying SNNs to short text classification are limited. This paper provides a new model that uses SNNs to classify short texts. SNNs are difficult to train directly when using deep models and cannot employ large-scale language models to learn good embeddings. To resolve the challenge, we apply the character-level encoding method and convert analog neural networks into SNNs. To begin with, we represent character-level text using a temporal-and-rate joint horizontal encoding method. Then we develop a tailored deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classifying texts. At the inference stage, we convert the tailored CNN model into an SNN model. To test the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct text encoding experiments on the NAMES dataset and short text classification experiments on both the 20-newsgroups dataset and the emoji-mult dataset. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can obtain classification accuracies that are better than or comparable to other methods.\",\n",

But what if what we think we know prevents us from seeing the bigger picture within and across museum collections? We argue that a machine-learning approach to provenance could allow the detection of broader patterns of unethical or even criminal behaviour that are embedded in the relationships underpinning museum collections. To demonstrate the potential of a machine-learning approach, we present a computer-assisted model that predicts plausible patterns and connections, \\u2018leads\\u2019 or \\u2018hot tips\\u2019, derived from a dataset of unstructured texts concerning the antiquities trade. Preliminary results have revealed what may have been a multi-decade scheme involving the donation of low-value Latin American antiquities to museums as a form of \\u2018reputation laundering\\u2019 potentially in advance of criminal fraud. We believe that such patterns could not be identified by an approach to museum provenance that is restricted to known problems within individual institution, demonstrating the need for innovative provenance tools and approaches that consider the complex networks within which museum objects exist.\",\n",

Recommender systems are an effective tool for this task. This study introduces a hybrid recommender system that combines collaborative filtering and content-based approaches to provide personalized movie recommendations. The proposed system considers age, gender, emotion, and genre attributes to ensure the suitability of the recommended movies. The proposed system targets the visitors of cinema theaters to try a new experience of choosing the next movie to watch by recognizing the visitor's face to determine his/her age, gender and emotion using camera. Therefore, our system is expected to achieve better results than traditional approaches. The system's performance is evaluated using standard metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-measure. The findings indicated that the proposed system outperforms the benchmark system in the most tested scenarios. However, the precision of the benchmark work is slightly higher in (8\\u201314 and 15\\u201324) age groups.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Background Extremities fractures are a leading cause of death and disability, especially in the elderly. Avulsion fracture are also the most commonly missed diagnosis, and delayed diagnosis leads to higher litigation rates. Therefore, this study evaluates the diagnostic efficiency of the artificial intelligence (AI) model before and after optimization based on computed tomography (CT) images and then compares it with that of radiologists, especially for avulsion fractures. Methods The digital X-ray photography [digital radiography (DR)] and CT images of adult limb trauma in our hospital from 2017 to 2020 were retrospectively collected, with or without 1 or more fractures of the shoulder, elbow, wrist, hand, hip, knee, ankle, and foot. Labeling of the fracture referred to the visualization of the fracture on the corresponding CT images. After training the pre-optimized AI model, the diagnostic performance of the pre-optimized AI, optimized AI model, and the initial radiological reports were evaluated. For the lesion level, the detection rate of avulsion and non-avulsion fractures was analyzed, whereas for the case level, the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were compared among them. Results The total datasets (1,035 cases) were divided into a training set (n=675), a validation set (n=169), and a test set (n=191) in a balanced joint distribution. At the lesion level, the detection rates of avulsion fracture (57.89% vs. 35.09%, P=0.004) and non-avulsion fracture (85.64% vs. 71.29%, P<0.001) by the optimized AI were significantly higher than that by pre-optimized AI. The average precision (AP) of the optimized AI model for all lesions was higher than that of pre-optimized AI model (0.582 vs. 0.425). The detection rate of avulsion fracture by the optimized AI model was significantly higher than that by radiologists (57.89% vs. 29.82%, P=0.002). For the non-avulsion fracture, there was no significant difference of detection rate between the optimized AI model and radiologists (P=0.853). At the case level, the accuracy (86.40% vs. 71.93%, P<0.001) and sensitivity (87.29% vs. 73.48%, P<0.001) of the optimized AI were significantly higher than those of the pre-optimized AI model. There was no statistical difference in accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity between the optimized AI model and the radiologists (P>0.05). Conclusions The optimized AI model improves the diagnostic efficacy in detecting extremity fractures on radiographs, and the optimized AI model is significantly better than radiologists in detecting avulsion fractures, which may be helpful in the clinical practice of orthopedic emergency.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"\\n Real-time monitoring through CCTV is a crucial aspect of offshore operations in all types of rigs. While this system is widely utilized in conventional drilling rigs, it is not as commonly used in hydraulic workover unit (HWU) rig and this create a huge gap in Red Zone Management and Operation Excellence in term of efficiency. The primary purpose of this system is to enhance red zone management, increase operational efficiency, and allow for remote operation or supervision.\\n Recently, this system was implemented for workover operations in Malaysia that utilized an HWU rig. Six ATEX-rated cameras were installed in critical areas of the HWU rig and the accommodation work barge (AWB). ATEX rated are required to comply Zone 2 requirement. A detailed site survey and engineering were conducted to install these cameras, which had never been installed before on an HWU rig. The system is wired, requiring a long cable connection from the HWU rig on the platform to the AWB and supervisor office. Additionally, it is connected to the project team's mobile devices, allowing for real-time monitoring, and enabling the team to observe operations from onshore.\\n This system provides supervisors with improved supervision of offshore operations, equipment movement, and HSE supervision. Prior to its implementation, supervisors only had voice communication via walkie-talkie and no visual access to the operation from the supervisor's office. Furthermore, engineers in the office and service providers can observe the operation, especially during critical jobs. The system also aids in HSE case investigation by providing footage for the investigation team to review using its playback feature.\\n This pilot system closes a significant gap in the HWU rig, improving red zone management, increasing operational efficiency, and allowing for remote operation or supervision. This paper outlines the system's functionalities, installation and engineering procedures, detailed implementation, and the future scope of artificial intelligence in closing gaps in terms of HSE and operation.\",\n",

Initially, it represented a great advance in everything that until now limited the human being. It also seems to have a series of risks that we are only beginning to be aware of. One of the technologies derived from AI is that of deepfakes, words that arise as an acronym when combining Deep, coming from how these intelligences learn, through deeplearning, and fake, whose translation would be false or falsification. It is a technology widely used in audiovisuals, both for cinema, television, or other types of videos, with variable results. However, the use of pornography of celebrities without their consent, or the deliberate interest in misinforming, at critical moments, are some of the problems faced by the use of this technology. Something that seems to reach a critical point when it comes to news since the presenters usually enjoy greater credibility\\u00a0for\\u00a0the\\u00a0viewer. Throughout this work, we will try to approach the use of artificial intelligence on television as well as Deepfakes, their uses, and\\u00a0risks.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Deep Neural Networks have achieved great success in many tasks and research especially in pattern recognition. However, high computing and large memory requirements prevent them from being applied to limited devices and require large costs. And Imbalance of data in Machine Learning refers to the unequal distribution of classes in a data set. This problem is often encountered in classification tasks where the distribution of classes within a given data set is not uniform. Given these problems, the researchers proposed the Light Neural Network method and added the Resampling method to Corn Leaf Disease data, to ease the computational process and balance the data. Researchers use several methods in machine learning which involve the use of knowledge that has been learned by existing models (Transfer Learning), including: MobileNet, EfficientNetB1 and Exception, as well as conducting comparisons between models. These models use the Depthwise Separable Convolution technique to reduce the number of parameters and convolution operations that need to be performed, thereby reducing the computational requirements and model complexity. The results of light neural network research and the combination of Resampling, the highest Transfer Learning model of 95% obtained from the EfficientNetB1 model than other Transfer learning models.\",\n",

A recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture was used for estimating the Hurst exponent, $H$, on small sections of tracks of probe spheres moving with fractional Brownian motion. Thus dynamic segmentation of tracks via neural networks was used in microrheology for the first time and it is significantly more accurate than using mean square displacements. An ensemble of 414 particles produces a mean squared displacement (MSD) that is subdiffusive in time, $t$, with a power law of the form $t^{0.74\\\\pm0.02}$, indicating power law viscoelasticity. RNN analysis of the probability distributions of $H$, combined with detailed analysis of the time-averaged MSDs of individual tracks, revealed diverse diffusion processes belied by the simple scaling of the ensemble MSD, such as caging phenomena, which give rise to the complex viscoelasticity of lamellar gels.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"As the saying goes, sometimes less is more \\u2013 and when it comes to neural networks, that couldn\\u2019t be more true. Enter pruning, the art of selectively trimming away unnecessary parts of a network to create a more streamlined, efficient architecture. In this paper, we introduce a novel end-to-end pipeline for model pruning via the frequency domain. This work aims to shed light on the interoperability of intermediate model outputs and their significance beyond the spatial domain. Our method, dubbed Common Frequency Domain Pruning (CFDP) aims to extrapolate common frequency characteristics defined over the feature maps to rank the individual channels of a layer based on their level of importance in learning the representation. By harnessing the power of CFDP, we have achieved state-of-the-art results on CIFAR-10 with GoogLeNet reaching an accuracy of 95.25%, that is, +0.2% from the original model. We also outperform all benchmarks and match the original model\\u2019s performance on ImageNet, using only 55% of the trainable parameters and 60% of the FLOPs. In addition to notable performances, models produced via CFDP exhibit robustness to a variety of configurations including pruning from untrained neural architectures, and resistance to adversarial attacks.

This study aimed to develop a more accurate LDL-C prediction model using machine learning methods.\\n\\n\\nMETHODS\\nThe study involved predicting directly measured LDL-C, using individual characteristics, lipid profiles, and other laboratory results as predictors. The models applied to predict LDL-C values were multiple regression, penalized regression, random forest, and XGBoost. Additionally, a novel 2-step prediction model was developed and introduced. The machine learning methods were evaluated against the Friedewald, Martin, and Sampson equations.\\n\\n\\nRESULTS\\nThe Friedewald, Martin, and Sampson equations had root mean squared error (RMSE) values of 12.112, 8.084, and 8.492, respectively, whereas the 2-step prediction model showed the highest accuracy, with an RMSE of 7.015. The LDL-C levels were also classified as a categorical variable according to the diagnostic criteria of the dyslipidemia treatment guideline, and concordance rates were calculated between the predictive values obtained from each method and the directly measured ones. The 2-step prediction model had the highest concordance rate (85.1%).\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\nThe machine learning method can calculate LDL-C more accurately than existing equations. The proposed 2-step prediction model, in particular, outperformed the other machine learning methods.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The topic of 3D drivable facial animation has been extensively studied for many years. Due to the limited audiovisual data and the uncertainty of the problem, it is still challenging to generate faithful facial motions. Most existing research focuses mainly on using audio information, which easily leads to excessively smooth lip movements during the generation. Considering the progress of multimodal learning and the advantages of phoneme-based mapping-driven approaches. We combine the phoneme and text representation into the task to enhance the relationship between speech and animation. Specifically, we present a novel multi-model fusion Transformer for the 3D facial generation that learns the features from audio, text, and phonemes modality. Utilizing the intrinsic relationship between phonemes and corresponding mouth movements can constrain excessive smoothness in the mapping from audio to mouth movements. Using powerful language representation models to obtain contextual semantic information from the text can eliminate facial animation biases caused by individual speaking characteristics in the audio. Additionally, to explore the rich information between modalities, we also introduce an attention-based fusion mechanism to integrate related features. The qualitative and quantitative experiments proved our method\\u2019s effectiveness.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Garbage classification not only helps to avoid resource wastage and environmental pollution but also reduces the cost of waste management, which is of significant importance for environmental protection. In order to promote the development of garbage classification, a high-precision garbage detection model that can be deployed on embedded devices is highly necessary. However, there are several problems with garbage detection models currently deployed on embedded devices, such as large algorithm parameters, large model sizes, and high computational complexity. To address these issues, a lightweight detection algorithm, Distilled_YOLOv5s_ABCS, was proposed by combining YOLOv5s and MobileNetV3. To compensate for the detection accuracy loss caused by the lightweight design, we use the coordinate attention module to replace the squeeze-and-excitation module in MobileNetV3 and add it to the head network. In addition, the integrated module of self-attention and convolution and spatial pyramid pooling fast module is added to the backbone network to improve feature extraction capabilities. The neck layer uses a weighted bidirectional feature pyramid network to enhance feature fusion. Finally, knowledge distillation is used to improve detection accuracy further. Experimental results show that compared to the original YOLOv5s algorithm, the Distilled_YOLOv5s_ABCS algorithm reduces the algorithm parameter quantity, computational complexity, and model size by 50.8%, 62.4%, and 50%, respectively, while slightly decreasing mean accuracy precision. Additionally, the image processing speed on the CPU increased by 21.3%. The mAP value of the Distilled_YOLOv5s_ABCS algorithm is 89.6%, which meets the requirements for deployment on embedded devices.\",\n",

At the current stage of science and technology development, artificial intelligence (AI) is being actively developed and gradually introduced into the healthcare system.Aim. To perform a literature review to assess the diagnostic value of AI in the detection of bladder cancer at the cystoscopy stage.Materials and methods. We carried out a bibliographic search of articles in Medline and Embase databases using the keywords \\u201cartificial intelligence\\u201d, \\u201ccystoscopy\\u201d, \\u201cTURBT\\u201d.Results. Automated image processing based on AI can improve the accuracy of cancer diagnosis during cystoscopy. According to the studies presented in the review, the sensitivity of AI system for the detection of bladder cancer via cystoscopy can reach 89.7\\u201395.4 %, while its specificity is 87.8\\u201398.6 %, which exceeds the diagnostic capabilities of standard cystoscopy in white light, the sensitivity and specificity of which, according to recent investigations, are approximately 60 and 70 %, respectively. Despite the promising results of these studies, modern science is currently at the stage of developing and evaluating the performance of various AI methods used to analyze cystoscopy images. To date, it would be premature to introduce and widely use these technologies in healthcare, since there are no prospective clinical studies to assess the effectiveness of AI systems in diagnostic cystoscopy and transurethral resection of bladder cancer.Conclusion. Few studies show that AI-based cystoscopy is a promising approach to improvement of the quality of medical care for bladder cancer. Further research is needed to improve the diagnostic capabilities of AI and introduce the obtained technological data into clinical practice.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Abstract. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles have shown to be one of the most disruptive technologies in over the last decades\\u2014having an impact on may different applications such as environmental monitoring, disaster management, land administration, and water management. The photogrammetric pipeline is the core building block that enables researchers and practictioners to deliver UAV-related solutions for these applications. Advances in deep learning show promising results that can help improve steps within this pipeline. This study specifically investigates the use of parallax attention mechanism for improving dense point cloud extraction from UAV imagery. We experimented with three different setups of applying this network and have compared it against a semi-global matching based method. The first setup directly applies a pretrained stereo matching network, the second finetunes the pretrained network on the UAV dataset, and the third retrains the network using disparity values derived from a reference DSM of lower resolution. Results show that there could be notable improvements on the accuracy of resulting extracted point cloud when using a parallax attention stereo matching network for the dense image matching step over the conventional semi-global matching method for the case of easier stereo pair with high overlap and lower occlusion. However, there seems to be unclear improvements when dealing with stereo pairs that are highly different compared to which the networks are originally trained on, e.g. longer-baselines resulting to lower overlap and more occlusions. Furthermore, retraining with a disparity values derived from a lower resolution DSM also does not improve the resulting point cloud.\\n\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"In collaborative robotics, to improve human\\u2013robot interaction (HRI), it is necessary to avoid accidental impacts. In this direction, several works reported how to modify the trajectories of collaborative robots (cobots), monitoring the operator\\u2019s position in the cobot workspace by industrial safety devices, cameras, or wearable tracking devices. The detection of the emotional state of the operator could further prevent possible dangerous situations. This work aimed to increase the predictability of anomalous behavior on the part of human operators by the implementation of emotional intelligence (EI) that allows a cobot to detect the operator\\u2019s Level of Attention (LoA), implicitly associated with the emotional state, and to decide the safest trajectory to complete a task. Consequently, the operator is induced to pay due attention, the safety rate of the HRI is improved, and the cobot downtime is reduced. The approach was based on a vision transformer (ViT) architecture trained and validated by the Level of Attention Dataset (LoAD), the ad hoc dataset created and developed on facial expressions and hand gestures. ViT was integrated into a digital twin of the Omron TM5-700 cobot, suitably developed within this project, and the effectiveness of the EI was tested on a pick-and-place task. Then, the proposed approach was experimentally validated with the physical cobot. The results of the simulation and experimentation showed that the goal of the work was achieved and the decision-making process can be successfully integrated into existing robot control strategies.\",\n",

In recent years, the remarkable capabilities of machine learning have revolutionized the field of natural sciences and have also demonstrated promising applications in the field of antibody humanization. Here, we present Protein-LAnguage-model-knN (PLAN), a machine learning model leveraging protein language model and information retrieval for improving humanization of antibodies.

      "      \"abstract\": \"Trust-aware recommendation plays an essential role in alleviating information overload by exploiting social relationships among users to build recommendation systems. However, recommendation systems in mobile social networks suffer from the sparse trust problem, which severely affects the reliability of trust propagation and the accuracy of the recommendation. The flourishing graph neural networks have revitalized Trust-aware Recommendation Systems. Therefore, we propose a sparse trust data mining method based on graph attention networks (TrustGAT) to mine potential trust information between entities in large-scale mobile social networks. First, the potential relationships between the trustors and the trustees are simulated in sparse data, and thereof an adaptive trust network is built. On this basis, features of trust-related information and items are learned in multi-head attention modules to enable the scheme stability. In addition, the implicit influence of trust is introduced to augment network node representation. Empirical results on three public benchmarks show that TrustGAT can make recommendation for users rapidly and accurately as well as alleviate the sparse trust problem effectively.\",\n",

When not detected early, this condition can lead to vision loss. Advanced image processing techniques and artificial intelligence algorithms have enhanced the possibilities of early diagnosis and treatment. This article discusses current advancements in artificial intelligence-based diabetic retinopathy detection and explores future possibilities in this field. \\nIn the experimental studies of the article, the Kaggle Aptos 2019 dataset was utilized. This dataset comprises 5 classes and a total of 3662 images. The class distribution is as follows: No DR (No Diabetic Retinopathy): 1805, Mild: 370, Moderate: 999, Severe: 193, Proliferative DR: 295. The study consists of four fundamental stages. These stages are (1) Feature extraction from VGG16 and VGG19 pretrained models, (2) Feature selection using NCA, Relieff, and Chi2, (3) Classification with Support Vector Machine classifier, (4) Recursive Majority Voting. \\nUsing the proposed method, a high accuracy of 99.18% is achieved. Furthermore, sensitivity of 100% for the No DR class, sensitivity of 100% for the Moderate class, sensitivity of 98.80% for the Severe class, and an F1-Score of 99.89% for the No DR class are obtained. \\nThis study demonstrates the effective utilization of machine learning methods in diabetic retinopathy diagnosis. The experimental results underscore the significant contributions of diabetic retinopathy patients' diagnosis and treatment processes.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Various data-driven modeling methods have been developed to predict the thermal field in metal additive manufacturing (AM). The generalization capability of these models has been shown with simulation, but rarely tested with online physical printing. Instead, this paper aims to study a practical issue in metal AM, i.e., how to predict the thermal field of yet-to-print parts online when only a few sensors are available . This work proposes an online thermal field prediction method using mapping and reconstruction, which could be integrated into a metal AM process for online performance control. Based on the similarity of temperature curves (curve segments of a temperature profile of one point), the thermal field mapping applies an artificial neural network to estimate the temperature curves of points on the yet-to-print layer from measured temperatures of certain points on the previously printed layer. With measured/predicted temperature profiles of several points on the same layer, the thermal field reconstruction proposes a reduced order model (ROM) to construct the temperature profiles of all points on the same layer, which could be used to build the temperature field of the entire layer. The training of ROM is performed with an extreme learning machine (ELM) for computational efficiency. Fifteen wire arc AM experiments and nine simulations are designed for thin walls with a fixed length and unidirectional printing of each layer. The test results indicate that the proposed prediction method could construct the thermal field of a yet-to-print layer within 0.1 seconds on a low-cost desktop computer (Intel Core i7-3770 CPU @ 3.40GHz processor, 24.0 GB RAM). Meanwhile, the method has acceptable generalization capability in most cases from lower layers to higher layers in the same simulation, as well as from one simulation to a new simulation on different AM process parameters. More importantly, after fine-tuning the proposed method with limited experimental data, the relative errors of all predicted temperature profiles on a new experiment are sufficiently small, which demonstrates the applicability and generalization of the proposed thermal field prediction method in online applications for metal AM.\",\n",

The training image data of thousands of images were obtained from Kaggle, including grape leaves with black rot disease, Esca disease virus, leaf blight disease, and healthy grape leaves. In order to expand the dataset and prevent overfitting, we carried out a series of preprocessing steps on the original dataset and divided the training and test sets in a 4:1 ratio. The test accuracy of our model reached 99.14% and the average F1-score reached 98.79%. This paper also compared the classification results of different model structures such as VGG-16 and RESNet50.

Some models unwillingly sometimes amplify the biases in the models and results in faulty and biased predictions which can lead to the inaccurate matching of profiles to the job description and result in wayward hiring processes. The biasness can be based on the parameters such as gender, address, etc., or biasness transferred from the programmer into the model while creating the model which is called unconscious bias. The models implemented in the research are Random Forest, Decision Tree, KNN Tree, AdaBoost, and XGBoost. The accuracies for the models Random Forest, Decision Tree, KNN Tree, AdaBoost, and XGBoost were 0.80, 0.81, 0.81, 0.78, and 0.84 respectively.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"SQL injection attacks present a significant risk to data center security. Traditional rule-based pattern matching techniques exhibit limitations, such as inability to adapt to new attack types, to give decision confidence and lower detection accuracy. Machine learning (ML) based approaches offer promising alternatives; however, their computational requirements and the increasing volume of network traffic pose challenges for their application in conventional hardware. Data Processing Units (DPUs) have emerged as the tailored computing platform for infrastructure related workloads within data centers including security. This paper evaluates the performance and efficiency of classical ML methods for SQL injection detection utilising computing resources on DPUs.In this study, 20 prominent ML models are tested against a dataset comprising 30,000 SQL payloads, and their performance is compared in a series of experiments. The results indicate that the Passive Aggressive Classifier is the most suitable model for near-real-time detection, achieving a detection latency of approximately 0.3\\u03bcs/sample with an accuracy of 99.78%. This paper demonstrates that ML methods can be efficiently and effectively deployed on DPUs for SQL injection detection, providing valuable insights into threat intelligence for enhancing data center security.

      "      \"abstract\": \"This article presents a postprocessing-based spectral\\u2013spatial classification (SSC) approach for hyperspectral (HS) images. The approach effectively overcomes the limitations of traditional pixel-based classifiers by integrating spectral and spatial information to achieve improved classification results. Specifically, the proposed method uses principal component analysis to transform the HS images and the Naive Bayes (NB) classifier to quickly derive spectral-posterior probabilities. Spatial-posterior probabilities are then computed using an adaptive fast Fourier transform (AFFT) and a probabilistic closeness function. These probabilities are then combined to generate a precise SSC map. The proposed approach is available in two distinct styles: the conventional NB\\u2013AFFT\\u2013SSC method and the proposed iterationwise variable sequencing based NB\\u2013AFFT\\u2013SSC (IVS\\u2013NB\\u2013AFFT\\u2013SSC) method, which classifies one designated class in each iteration. In addition, two wrapper-based feature selection methods are proposed to obtain a set of principal components (PCs) for each class of the HS image, significantly improving classification accuracy. The approach's efficacy is demonstrated through extensive experimentation on three real HS datasets, including Washington DC Mall, Salinas-A, and Botswana. The generality of the approach has been proven through the use of other well-known machine-learning algorithms, such as support vector machine and K-nearest neighbor, as wrappers in the approach. The results confirm that the proposed approach is highly effective, with the IVS approach helping users concentrate on a particular set of PCs for the class of interest.\",\n",

In this paper, a short-term load forecasting method based on a combined method of mutual information (MI) and bi-directional long short-term memory (BILSTM) is proposed. In order to demonstrate the rationality and validity of the proposed method, real-world data has been utilized and the LSTM-based model are implemented in Python and are run on an NVIDIA 3070 GPU.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Plant species recognition is an important topic in forest remote sensing. In the past, people have used laboratory plant images to design different recognition methods. Some applied machine learning algorithms to perform species recognition on the plant RGB images, while others started to use deep learning (DL) approaches, such as convolutional neural network (CNN), to improve recognition performance. However, two issues arise: Firstly, many species with similar appearance are difficult to be correctly classified by CNN under the limited spectral information of RGB imaging. Secondly, the existing CNN-based classification models are designed for particular datasets and thus are not suitable for plant images. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a revolutionary framework that combines hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and DL technologies to perform plant species classification with a large number of species. We collected canopy images of 100 plant species via a Visible-NIR hyperspectral camera, and built an plant canopy dataset which consists of 3250 training images and 3250 test ones. Furthermore, we designed a lightweight CNN model that utilizes both 3D CNN and 2D CNN modules to implement spectral information fusion and spectral-spatial features extraction, called Hybrid-CNN. Experimental results show that Hybrid-CNN achieved at least 98% in overall accuracy rate and 0.98 in Kappa coefficient, and significantly outperformed the reference classification models.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Advances in artificial intelligence have raised a basic question about human intelligence: Is human reasoning best emulated by applying task-specific knowledge acquired from a wealth of prior experience, or is it based on the domain-general manipulation and comparison of mental representations? We address this question for the case of visual analogical reasoning. Using realistic images of familiar three-dimensional objects (cars and their parts), we systematically manipulated viewpoints, part relations, and entity properties in visual analogy problems. We compared human performance to that of two recent deep learning models (Siamese Network and Relation Network) that were directly trained to solve these problems and to apply their task-specific knowledge to analogical reasoning. We also developed a new model using part-based comparison (PCM) by applying a domain-general mapping procedure to learned representations of cars and their component parts. Across four-term analogies (Experiment 1) and open-ended analogies (Experiment 2), the domain-general PCM model, but not the task-specific deep learning models, generated performance similar in key aspects to that of human reasoners. These findings provide evidence that human-like analogical reasoning is unlikely to be achieved by applying deep learning with big data to a specific type of analogy problem. Rather, humans do (and machines might) achieve analogical reasoning by learning representations that encode structural information useful for multiple tasks, coupled with efficient computation of relational similarity.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Microgrid is a small-scale power grid composed of various distributed energy resources, and net load forecasting (NLF) plays significant role in its energy generation planning. Due to the dispersed distribution of nodes within the microgrid and disparate user data, completing the net load forecasting task becomes challenging. In order to efficiently forecast the net load while ensuring data security, this paper proposes an approach for NLF based on federated learning (FL). Firstly, a FL framework for NLF in microgrids is constructed to complete the NLF task with long short-term memory neural network (LSTM) model and node selection (NS) in aggregation. Secondly, considering factors such as the data precision and quantity, an accuracy optimization problem model is proposed. Then, the problem is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP), and a NS algorithm based on Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) is designed for selecting a node set to optimize model aggregation. The simulation demonstrate that the proposed NS method based on A3C improves the performance of FL, resulting in better convergence of LSTM network and ensuring the scalability of the cluster in microgrid.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The modern electronic device antenna poses challenges regarding broader bandwidth and isolation due to its multiple features and seamless user experience. A compact vase-shaped two-port ultrawideband (UWB) antenna is presented in this work. A circular monopole antenna is modified by embedding the multiple curved segments onto the radiator and rectangular slotted ground plane to develop impedance matching in the broader bandwidth from 4 to 12.1 GHz. The UWB monopole antenna is recreated horizontally with a separation of less than a quarter wavelength of 0.13 \\u03bb (\\u03bb computed at 4 GHz) to create a UWB multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) antenna with a geometry of 20 \\u00d7 29 \\u00d7 1.6 mm3. The isolation in the UWB MIMO antenna is enhanced by inserting an inverted pendulum-shaped parasitic element on the ground plane. This modified ground plane acts as a decoupling structure and provides isolation below 21 dB across the 5\\u201313.5 GHz operating frequency. The proposed UWB MIMO antenna\\u2019s significant modes and their contribution to antenna radiation are analyzed by characteristic mode analysis. Further, the proposed antenna is investigated for MIMO diversity features, and its values are found to be ECC < 0.002, DG \\u2248 10 dB, TARC < \\u221210 dB, CCL < 0.3 bps/Hz, and MEG < \\u22123 dB. The proposed antenna\\u2019s time domain characteristics in different antenna orientations show a group delay of less than 1 ns and a fidelity factor larger than 0.9.\",\n",

In addition, supply chains continue to grow in size and complexity which further sophisticates the problem. Lack of a structured approach and limitations in existing risk management methods contribute towards effective mitigation strategies not being properly developed. In this paper, we develop a discrete event simulation modelling approach to quantify the performance and risk assessment of a manufacturing supply chain in Sweden which is under the impact of risks. This approach could support decision makers by prioritizing risks according to their performance impact and facilitating the development of mitigation strategies to enhance the resilience of the supply chain. The conceptual digital model can also be used to generate synthetic data to build an artificial intelligence-enhanced predictive demonstrator model to showcase capabilities for building data-driven resilience of the supply chain.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated promising results in various complex tasks. However, current DNNs encounter challenges with over-parameterization, especially when there is limited training data available. To enhance the generalization capability of DNNs, the Mixup technique has gained popularity. Nevertheless, it still produces suboptimal outcomes. Inspired by the successful Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) approach, which establishes a connection between the sharpness of the training loss landscape and model generalization, we propose a new learning framework called Generalized-Mixup, which combines the strengths of Mixup and SAM for training DNN models. The theoretical analysis provided demonstrates how the developed G-Mix framework enhances generalization. Additionally, to further optimize DNN performance with the G-Mix framework, we introduce two novel algorithms: Binary G-Mix and Decomposed G-Mix. These algorithms partition the training data into two subsets based on the sharpness-sensitivity of each example to address the issue of\\\"manifold intrusion\\\"in Mixup. Both theoretical explanations and experimental results reveal that the proposed BG-Mix and DG-Mix algorithms further enhance model generalization across multiple datasets and models, achieving state-of-the-art performance.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Dietary nucleic acids (dietNAs) are being increasingly recognized as important food components with nutritional value. However, the precise dietary recommendations for dietNAs are limited, because established methods for determining the quantity and nutritional role of dietNAs are still lacking. One of the tools to narrow this gap could be microscopic imaging, as a convenient approach to visualize the abundance and distribution of dietNAs in food products. With the aid of appropriate bioinformatic elaboration, such images may in future enable the direct semiquantitative estimation of these macromolecules in food products. In the presented study, two methods of preparing microscopic sections and staining them with DNA-specific fluorochromes were used for microscopic imaging of dietNAs in food products of plant and animal origin. Procedures for preparing formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections and cryosections were compared in terms of their usefulness for routine food analysis. Both methods turned out equally suitable for visualizing dietNA distribution in animal and plant products. However, the use of cryosections allowed a significantly shorter analysis time and reduced the consumption of organic solvents. Both of these advantages make the cryosection method preferable while establishing a dedicated methodology for routine assessment of dietNAs in the food industry.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Crossbar arrays based on emerging memristor technology offer significant power savings when running Artificial Neural Network (ANN) applications. An additional advantage of this technology is its non-volatility, which eliminates the need for costly loading of a complete ANN model from conventional memories, thus saving power and allowing immediate system availability. However, this advantage can arguably be seen as a disadvantage from a security perspective, since the ANN model remains on the crossbar indefinitely and is therefore vulnerable to theft. On the other hand, a disadvantage of the current memristor technology is its significantly limited write endurance. Considering these two constraints, we propose a highly secure and yet simple deployment method: \\\"S3cure\\\", which does not require encryption of individual stored values in the memristor, thus avoiding rewriting after each decryption and also rendering useless any unwanted extraction of the ANN model from the crossbar. In our proposed methodology, the ANN model is permuted before deployment by multiplying the model weight matrices with permutation matrices, and the inverse permutation vectors of these matrices become the access key needed at runtime to correctly exploit the model. The analysis and testing of our \\\"S3cure\\\" method reveals extremely difficult brute-force reverse engineering, proportional to the key size, and also shows a limited one-time performance overhead incurred by this implementation.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The advent of Industry 4.0 has precipitated the incorporation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods within industrial contexts, aiming to realize intelligent manufacturing, operation as well as maintenance, also known as industrial intelligence. However, intricate industrial milieus, particularly those relating to energy exploration and production, frequently encompass data characterized by long-tailed class distribution, sample imbalance, and domain shift. These attributes pose noteworthy challenges to data-centric Deep Learning (DL) techniques, crucial for the realization of industrial intelligence. The present study centers on the intricate and distinctive industrial scenarios of Nuclear Power Generation (NPG), meticulously scrutinizing the application of DL techniques under the constraints of finite data samples. Initially, the paper expounds on potential employment scenarios for AI across the full life-cycle of NPG. Subsequently, we delve into an evaluative exposition of DL's advancement, grounded in the finite sample perspective. This encompasses aspects such as small-sample learning, few-shot learning, zero-shot learning, and open-set recognition, also referring to the unique data characteristics of NPG. The paper then proceeds to present two specific case studies. The first revolves around the automatic recognition of zirconium alloy metallography, while the second pertains to open-set recognition for signal diagnosis of machinery sensors. These cases, spanning the entirety of NPG's life-cycle, are accompanied by constructive outcomes and insightful deliberations. By exploring and applying DL methodologies within the constraints of finite sample availability, this paper not only furnishes a robust technical foundation but also introduces a fresh perspective toward the secure and efficient advancement and exploitation of this advanced energy source.\",\n",

      "      \"title\": \"Securing MIMO Wiretap Channel with Learning-Based Friendly Jamming under Imperfect CSI\",\n",
      "      \"abstract\": \"Wireless communications are particularly vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks due to their broadcast nature. To effectively deal with eavesdroppers, existing security techniques usually require accurate channel state information (CSI), e.g., for friendly jamming (FJ), and/or additional computing resources at transceivers, e.g., cryptography-based solutions, which unfortunately may not be feasible in practice. This challenge is even more acute in low-end IoT devices. We thus introduce a novel deep learning-based FJ framework that can effectively defeat eavesdropping attacks with imperfect CSI and even without CSI of legitimate channels. In particular, we first develop an autoencoder-based communication architecture with FJ, namely AEFJ, to jointly maximize the secrecy rate and minimize the block error rate at the receiver without requiring perfect CSI of the legitimate channels. In addition, to deal with the case without CSI, we leverage the mutual information neural estimation (MINE) concept and design a MINE-based FJ scheme that can achieve comparable security performance to the conventional FJ methods that require perfect CSI. Extensive simulations in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system demonstrate that our proposed solution can effectively deal with eavesdropping attacks in various settings. Moreover, the proposed framework can seamlessly integrate MIMO security and detection tasks into a unified end-to-end learning process. This integrated approach can significantly maximize the throughput and minimize the block error rate, offering a good solution for enhancing communication security in wireless communication systems.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Land cover (LC) maps are used extensively for nature conservation and landscape planning, but low spatial resolution and coarse LC schemas typically limit their applicability to large, broadly defined habitats. In order to target smaller and more-specific habitats, LC maps must be developed at high resolution and fine class detail using automated methods that can efficiently scale to large areas of interest. In this work, we present a Machine Learning approach that addresses this challenge. First, we developed a multi-stage semantic segmentation approach that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify LC across the Peak District National Park (PDNP, 1439 km2) in the UK using a detailed, hierarchical LC schema. High-level classes were predicted with 95% accuracy and were subsequently used as masks to predict low-level classes with 72% to 92% accuracy. Next, we used these predictions to analyse the degree and distribution of fragmentation of one specific habitat\\u2014wet grassland and rush pasture\\u2014at the landscape scale in the PDNP. We found that fragmentation varied across areas designated as primary habitat, highlighting the importance of high-resolution LC maps provided by CNN-powered analysis for nature conservation.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Autonomous flight in unknown environments requires precise planning for both the spatial and temporal profiles of trajectories, which generally involves nonconvex optimization, leading to high time costs and susceptibility to local optima. To address these limitations, we introduce the Learning-Initialized Trajectory Planner (LIT-Planner), a novel approach that guides optimization using a Neural Network (NN) Planner to provide initial values. We first leverage the spatial-temporal optimization with batch sampling to generate training cases, aiming to capture multimodality in trajectories. Based on these data, the NN-Planner maps visual and inertial observations to trajectory parameters for handling unknown environments. The network outputs are then optimized to enhance both reliability and explainability, ensuring robust performance. Furthermore, we propose a framework that supports robust online replanning with tolerance to planning latency. Comprehensive simulations validate the LIT-Planner's time efficiency without compromising trajectory quality compared to optimization-based methods. Real-world experiments further demonstrate its practical suitability for autonomous drone navigation.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Photonics neuromorphic computing shows great prospects due to the advantages of low latency, low power consumption and high bandwidth. Transistors with asymmetric electrode structures are receiving increasing attention due to their low power consumption, high optical response, and simple preparation technology. However, intelligent optical synapses constructed by asymmetric electrodes are still lacking systematic research and mechanism analysis. Herein, we present an asymmetric electrode structure of the light-stimulated synaptic transistor (As-LSST) with a bulk heterojunction as the semiconductor layer. The As-LSST exhibits superior electrical properties, photosensitivity and multiple biological synaptic functions, including excitatory postsynaptic currents, paired-pulse facilitation, and long-term memory. Benefitting from the asymmetric electrode configuration, the devices can operate under a very low drain voltage of 1 \\u00d7 10-7 V, and achieve an ultra-low energy consumption of 2.14 \\u00d7 10-18 J per light stimulus event. Subsequently, As-LSST implemented the optical logic function and associative learning. Utilizing As-LSST, an artificial neural network (ANN) with ultra-high recognition rate (over 97.5%) of handwritten numbers was constructed. This work presents an easily-accessible concept for future neuromorphic computing and intelligent electronic devices.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Many tools have been developed to simulate unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) motion and autonomous behaviors to evaluate UUV capabilities. However, there is no simulator that performs real-time modeling of the complex hydrodynamic interaction forces that a UUV experiences when operating near a moving submarine. These hydrodynamic interactions must be determined in real time to simulate the launch and recovery of UUVs from submarines. Potential flow models may be fast enough to solve the hydrodynamic interactions in real time, but by oversimplifying the physics and neglecting viscosity, they introduce inaccuracies into the simulations. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is capable of accurately modeling these hydrodynamic interactions, but simulations take hours or days to solve. To overcome this obstacle, a machine learning method known as Gaussian process (GP) regression is used to create a surrogate reduced-order-model that predicts the hydrodynamic interactions in real time. The GP regression model is trained by actively sampling CFD simulations in order to accurately model complex hydrodynamic interactions. This new approach allows the GP regression model to be incorporated into a UUV motion simulator and evaluate how the UUV is affected by the hydrodynamic interactions. Operating envelopes are developed that outline regions where the UUV safely overcomes the hydrodynamic interactions and where the UUV is overpowered and collides with the submarine. By incorporating this surrogate model into the autonomy architecture, new autonomous behaviors are created that compensate for the hydrodynamic interactions by adjusting the desired UUV heading and speed which allows it to better stay on course.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The hunt for early Alzheimer's disease detection has created cutting-edge diagnostic instruments with enormous promise. This article examines the many facets of these developments, focusing on how they have revolutionised diagnosis and patient outcomes. These tools make it possible to detect tiny brain changes even before they give birth to clinical symptoms by combining cutting-edge biomarkers, neuroimaging methods, and machine-learning algorithms. A significant opportunity for therapies that can slow the course of the disease exists during this early detection stage. Additionally, these cutting-edge techniques improve diagnostic precision, objectivity, and accessibility. Liquid biopsies and blood-based biomarkers provide non-invasive alternatives, filling accessibility gaps in diagnosis. While issues with standardisation, ethics, and data integration continue, collaboration within research, clinical practice, and policy realms fuels positive developments. As technology advances, the way towards better Alzheimer's diagnosis becomes more evident, giving patients and families dealing with this difficult illness fresh hope. The synergy between scientific advancement and compassionate treatment is crucial for improving Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, as this paper emphasises.\",\n",

The approach put forward in this study blends information extracted from a picture using a pre-trained convolutional neural network(CNN) with a gated recurrent unit (GRU) to produce captions. The suggested model is assessed on flickr8k and flickr30k datasets and gets impressive outcomes. The GRU\\u2019s incorporation enables modelling of long-term word relationships in the output captions. Overall, by effectively collecting contextual information and interactions between items in the image, this method seeks to advance existing image captioning methodologies. Hence, this method helps to create advanced models to give the appropriate and accurate results in caption generation.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"An artificial intelligence-generated content-enhanced computer-aided diagnosis (AIGC-CAD) model, designated as ThyGPT, has been developed. This model, inspired by the architecture of ChatGPT, could assist radiologists in assessing the risk of thyroid nodules through semantic-level human-machine interaction. A dataset comprising 19,165 thyroid nodule ultrasound cases from Zhejiang Cancer Hospital was assembled to facilitate the training and validation of the model. After training, ThyGPT could automatically evaluate thyroid nodule and engage in effective communication with physicians through human-computer interaction. The performance of ThyGPT was rigorously quantified using established metrics such as the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity. The empirical findings revealed that radiologists, when supplemented with ThyGPT, markedly surpassed the diagnostic acumen of their peers utilizing traditional methods as well as the performance of the model in isolation. These findings suggest that AIGC-CAD systems, exemplified by ThyGPT, hold the promise to fundamentally transform the diagnostic workflows of radiologists in forthcoming years.\",\n",

The combination of these algorithms is reproduced by an alteration of the step of creating a new generation from the most capable agents with the creation of a new generation through the Backpropagation method using the preventively saved data of the most capable agent from the environment. Thus, for the new generation, a Neural Network trained with backpropagation is assigned instead of the best-performing Neural Network from the previous generation. As a result, the Neuroevolution with the Backpropagation method shows better performance when increasing the target of the environmental performance of the agent.\",\n",

Hence, forecasting volatility is a critical component in risk management, optimizing portfolios, and in algorithmic trading among other financial problems. There have been few machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques used in the literature for the forecasting problem. Transformer Network (TN) architecture is one of newest such techniques proposed. In this work, we utilized this architecture with multi-head attention mechanism for volatility forecasting. To enhance the performance of the TN, we incorporated different variations of the feed forward layer. The performance of three distinct TN models was evaluated by implementing three different deep learning layers (CNN, LSTM, and a hybrid layer (CNN-LSTM)) in the encoder block of TN as the feed forward layer. The results clearly demonstrate that the TN model with the hybrid layer (CNN-LSTM) outperformed the other models, including a recently proposed data-driven approach.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Abstract Background Artificial intelligence (AI) is gaining recognition as a promising adjunct in healthcare including gastrointestinal endoscopy. Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated improved polyp detection with computer-aided detection (CADe) systems in colonoscopy. Despite the foreseeable translation of CADe systems into the endoscopy suite, no study to date has explored how introducing this novel technology influences endoscopist perceptions and cognitive processes. Aims To explore how AI assistance impacts endoscopists\\u2019 perceptions of and cognitive processes during colonoscopy. Methods Faculty in gastroenterology and general surgery at the University Health Network (Toronto, Canada) were interviewed in April 2023 to explore their baseline perceptions of AI before the planned installation of the Medtronic GI GeniusTM Intelligent Endoscopy Module, an AI polyp detection tool, at Toronto Western Hospital in May 2023. After performing a minimum of 10 colonoscopies using GI GeniusTM, participants were re-interviewed to discuss their perceptions of AI-assisted colonoscopy and how it influenced their cognition during the procedure. Analysis was informed by constructivist grounded theory, whereby interview data were transcribed and coded iteratively using constant comparison to generate themes. Results In this interim constant comparative analysis, 9 participants (6 gastroenterologists and 3 general surgeons) were interviewed to generate 16 interview transcripts (9 pre-exposure and 7 post-exposure; 1 interview pending, 1 participant on leave). Participants held the view that: (1) AI will inevitably become the standard of care in colonoscopy, where clinicians and AI function symbiotically and in partnership; (2) CADe systems may facilitate standardization of practice and reduce inter-endoscopist variability by improving detection of specific types of lesions (e.g., sessile serrated polyps); (3) CADe assistance provides a \\u201csecond set of eyes\\u201d that interacts with, but does not replace, endoscopists\\u2019 cognitive processes; and (4) trainees should gain familiarity with AI systems, despite mixed opinions regarding AI\\u2019s specific role in training. Conclusions We found that study participants conceptualize AI as an essential component of colonoscopy practice and training, with endoscopist thought processes and CADe systems appearing to function symbiotically. Elucidating the specific ways in which AI and endoscopist cognition interact will facilitate the future refinement of these tools. Funding Agencies None\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is already here, and is speedily transforming industries. This paper examines the impact of AI on the socio-political rights of the people globally, particularly in the area of job loss. Automation is not a new concept. It can be traced to the introduction of machines into industries back in the Second and Third Industrial Revolutions. However, the automation introduced by artificial intelligence is of a higher level. Artificial Intelligence is taking risks for humans in the manufacturing industry, mining industry, and even in the Military. It is versatile, that is, it is capable of being used in every sector of the world, and with the rate of technological unemployment, (caused by automation), the significance of Artificial Intelligence has become subject to controversy. This research adopts a desk based doctrinal research methodology to examine the issue of socio-economic human rights in era of automation. This research discovers that AI will create jobs, but an analysis of research studies on job loss due to automation reveals the large margin between jobs created by AI and jobs lost due to AI, thus posing threats to socio-economic human rights. It also discovers that the jobs created by AI require only persons with technical skills and knowledge for employment in the nearest future. AI will cause deskilling and falling wages. This research work recommends that legislations must be put in place to ensure that the use of AI technologies are controlled in order to give the government enough time to balance the inequality created by AI technologies. Technical skills acquisition and robot tax can be adopted by nations to enable them cope with the speed of AI.\",\n",

To address this problem, we propose to use artificial neural networks combined with an innovative approach wherein each transistor's dimensions were first predicted using its own network to identify potential learning behavior differences. Some transistors exhibited favorable validation loss levels, while others displayed up to 3 times higher loss values. Building upon this observation, a focused approach was developed, involving the splitting of prediction tasks into two individual networks. The first targeted transistors with low validation losses and relied solely on circuit performance metrics as inputs. The second, designed for challenging transistors, introduced a novel input structure encompassing not only the performance metrics but also the dimensions of other well-trained transistors. This adjustment led to a notable reduction in both training and validation losses by 3.5 times, thus enhancing prediction accuracy for the challenging transistors. These findings underscore the importance of tailored artificial neural networks in enabling more efficient transistor sizing and present a promising approach for advancing analog integrated circuit design automation. Furthermore, this study contributes to the understanding of machine learning efficiency in the context of analog design.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Most people around the globe are dying due to heart disease. The main reason behind the rapid increase in the death rate due to heart disease is that there is no infrastructure developed for the healthcare department that can provide a secure way of data storage and transmission. Due to redundancy in the patient data, it is difficult for cardiac Professionals to predict the disease early on. This rapid increase in the death rate due to heart disease can be controlled by monitoring and eliminating some of the key attributes in the early stages such as blood pressure, cholesterol level, body weight, and addiction to smoking. Patient data can be monitored by cardiac Professionals (Cp) by using the advanced framework in the healthcare departments. Blockchain is the world's most reliable provider. The use of advanced systems in the healthcare departments providing new ways of dealing with diseases has been developed as well. In this article Machine Learning (ML) algorithm known as a sine-cosine weighted k-nearest neighbor (SCA-WKNN) is used for predicting the Hearth disease with the maximum accuracy among the existing approaches. Blockchain technology has been used in the research to secure the data throughout the session and can give more accurate results using this technology. The performance of the system can be improved by using this algorithm and the dataset proposed has been improved by using different resources as well.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Hypernetworks, or hypernets in short, are neural networks that generate weights for another neural network, known as the target network. They have emerged as a powerful deep learning technique that allows for greater flexibility, adaptability, dynamism, faster training, information sharing, and model compression etc. Hypernets have shown promising results in a variety of deep learning problems, including continual learning, causal inference, transfer learning, weight pruning, uncertainty quantification, zero-shot learning, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning etc. Despite their success across different problem settings, currently, there is no review available to inform the researchers about the developments and to help in utilizing hypernets. To fill this gap, we review the progress in hypernets. We present an illustrative example to train deep neural networks using hypernets and propose categorizing hypernets based on five design criteria as inputs, outputs, variability of inputs and outputs, and architecture of hypernets. We also review applications of hypernets across different deep learning problem settings, followed by a discussion of general scenarios where hypernets can be effectively employed. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future directions that remain under-explored in the field of hypernets. We believe that hypernetworks have the potential to revolutionize the field of deep learning. They offer a new way to design and train neural networks, and they have the potential to improve the performance of deep learning models on a variety of tasks. Through this review, we aim to inspire further advancements in deep learning through hypernetworks.\",\n",

Although adversarial effects and robustness in image classification models have been heavily investigated, robustness of action recognition models to natural or adversarial perturbations remain largely unexplored. Moreover, even though transformer based approaches have shown great promise on various vision tasks, they have yet to be evaluated in terms of their robustness. To this end, we propose a Semantic Video Transformer for Action Recognition (SeViTAR), which maps visual features obtained by a video transformer to a more robust visual-semantic representation.

      "      \"abstract\": \"Abstract This study was carried out to predict the zooplankton density in the Cip reservoir (Elaz\\u0131\\u011f) with an artificial neural network, using some water quality parameters. The plankton samples were collected monthly from Cip Reservoir in 2021- 2022, using a standard plankton net from three stations. Water temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, electrical conductivity, secchi disk, alkalinity, total nitrogen and total phosphorus were measured. The actual values of zooplankton density and results obtained from the artificial neural networks were compared. Mean absolute percent error (MAPE) values were calculated with actual values and ANNs values. ANNs values were determined to be close to the real data. MAPE percentage value at the first station was determined as 1.143 for Rotifer, 0.118 for Cladocera, and 0.141 for Copepoda. The MAPE percentage value at the second station was determined as 0.941 for Rotifer, 0.377 for Cladocera, and 0.185 for Copepoda. The MAPE percentage value at the third station was determined as 0.342 for Rotifer, 0.557 for Cladocera, and 0.301 for Copepoda. In the present study, it has been seen that artificial neural networks with a learning feature are successful in predicting zooplankton densities in an aquatic environment. It can be concluded from the study that ANNs are a powerful tool for understanding their relationships with the environment\",\n",

Secondly, it consists of constructing a learner model, an English learning resource personalized recommendation algorithm to constitute an English learning resource recommendation model, and using a collaborative decomposition algorithm and a regularization algorithm to integrate the potential, multifaceted trust relationship between users with the traditional scoring matrix, a process that emphasizes that trust between users in English teaching varies by different factors and strengths. Then, a personalized recommendation-based university English learning software was designed, and English learning software applications were analyzed by example. The results showed that the adjusted means of pre and post-test scores of the control group, experimental group one, and experimental group two were 77.37, 80.94, and 75.12, respectively, and the statistical score result F=5.33, P<05 indicated that there was a significant difference in the change of English performance of these three groups, which verified that the teaching software had a facilitating effect on the improvement of English teaching quality.\",\n",

In the first case, we get an estimate which optimally depends on the topology of the sets, thus generalizing a result by Croke, Osserman and Taylor, originally devised for the first eigenvalue of the Dirichlet-Laplacian. We also consider some limit situations, like the sharp Moser-Trudinger constant and the Cheeger constant. As a a byproduct of our discussion, we also obtain a Buser--type inequality for open subsets of the plane, with given topology. An interesting problem on the sharp constant for this inequality is presented.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"- Parkinson's Disease (PD) recognition generally depends on the valuation of clinical signs and medical observations, which includes the characterization of various motor symptoms. However, classical diagnostic techniques may undergo bias since they depend on activity assessment that can be irregularly delicate to human vision and thus tough to categorize, causing probable misclassification. Simultaneously, initial non-motor PD indications will be insignificant, and others will occur in many other circumstances. Hence, such indications were often unnoticed, making PD diagnosis at an initial stage challenging. For solving such complexities and for refining the assessment procedures and diagnosis of PD, Deep Learning (DL) approaches were applied for classifying PD and vigorous controls or patients who have clinical performances (for example, other Parkinsonian syndromes or movement disorders). This study develops an Automated PD Detection using Feature Selection with Optimal Stacked Autoencoder (APDD-FSOSAE) technique. The presented APDD-FSOSAE technique focuses on assessing PD using Feature Selection (FS) and DL approaches. To attain this, the presented APDD-FSOSAE model comprises the design of a chicken swarm optimization-based FS approach for the selection of optimum features. Next, the APDD-FSOSAE technique utilizes SAE for detecting and classifying PD. Finally, the hyperparameters of the SAE model can be optimally selected by the Bayesian Optimization (BO) model. The investigational output evaluation of the APDD-FSOSAE approach is examined on a benchmark PD dataset. The experimental outputs suggested that the APDD-FSOSAE approach results in improved PD detection results over other models.\",\n",

However, a method capable of recognizing all important anterior segment structures for clinical diagnosis is lacking. By sharing the knowledge learned from each task, we proposed a fully automated multitask deep learning method that allows for simultaneous segmentation and quantification of all major anterior segment structures, including the iris, lens, cornea, as well as implantable collamer lens (ICL) and intraocular lens (IOL), and meanwhile for landmark detection of scleral spur and iris root in anterior segment OCT (AS-OCT) images. In addition, we proposed a refraction correction method to correct for the true geometry of the anterior segment distorted by light refraction during OCT imaging. 1251 AS-OCT images from 180 patients were collected and were used to train and test the model. Experiments demonstrated that our proposed network was superior to state-of-the-art segmentation and landmark detection methods, and close agreement was achieved between manually and automatically computed clinical parameters associated with anterior chamber, pupil, iris, ICL, and IOL. Finally, as an example, we demonstrated how our proposed method can be applied to facilitate the clinical evaluation of cataract surgery.\",\n",

Existing algorithms that provide risk-awareness to NNs are complex and ad-hoc. Specifically, these methods require significant engineering changes, are often developed only for particular settings, and are not easily composable. Here we present capsa, a framework for extending models with risk-awareness. Capsa provides a methodology for quantifying multiple forms of risk and composing different algorithms together to quantify different risk metrics in parallel. We validate capsa by implementing state-of-the-art uncertainty estimation algorithms within the capsa framework and benchmarking them on complex perception datasets. We demonstrate capsa's ability to easily compose aleatoric uncertainty, epistemic uncertainty, and bias estimation together in a single procedure, and show how this approach provides a comprehensive awareness of NN risk.\",\n",

      "      \"title\": \"Role of sureness in evaluating AI/CADx: Lesion-based repeatability of machine learning\\u00a0classification performance on breast MRI.\",\n",
      "      \"abstract\": \"BACKGROUND\\nArtificial intelligence/computer-aided diagnosis (AI/CADx) and its use of radiomics have shown potential in diagnosis and prognosis of breast cancer. Performance metrics such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) are frequently used as figures of merit for the evaluation of CADx. Methods for evaluating lesion-based measures of performance may enhance the assessment of AI/CADx pipelines, particularly in the situation of comparing performances by classifier.\\n\\n\\nPURPOSE\\nThe purpose of this study was to investigate the use case of two standard classifiers to (1) compare overall classification performance of the classifiers in the task of distinguishing between benign and malignant breast lesions using radiomic features extracted from dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (DCE-MR) images, (2) define a new repeatability metric (termed sureness), and (3) use sureness to examine if one classifier provides an advantage in AI diagnostic performance by lesion when using radiomic features.\\n\\n\\nMETHODS\\nImages of 1052 breast lesions (201 benign, 851 cancers) had been retrospectively collected under HIPAA/IRB compliance. The lesions had been segmented automatically using a fuzzy c-means method and thirty-two radiomic features had been extracted. Classification was investigated for the task of malignant lesions (81% of the dataset) versus benign lesions (19%). Two classifiers (linear discriminant analysis, LDA and support vector machines, SVM) were trained and tested within 0.632 bootstrap analyses (2000 iterations). Whole-set classification performance was evaluated at two levels: (1) the 0.632+ bias-corrected area under the ROC curve (AUC) and (2) performance metric curves which give variability in operating sensitivity and specificity at a target operating point (95% target sensitivity). Sureness was defined as 1-95% confidence interval of the classifier output for each lesion for each classifier. Lesion-based repeatability was evaluated at two levels: (1) repeatability profiles, which represent the distribution of sureness across the decision threshold and (2) sureness of each lesion. The latter was used to identify lesions with better sureness with one classifier over another while maintaining lesion-based performance across the bootstrap iterations.\\n\\n\\nRESULTS\\nIn classification performance assessment, the median and 95% CI of difference in AUC between the two classifiers did not show evidence of difference (\\u0394AUC\\u00a0=\\u00a0-0.003 [-0.031, 0.018]). Both classifiers achieved the target sensitivity. Sureness was more consistent across the classifier output range for the SVM classifier than the LDA classifier. The SVM resulted in a net gain of 33 benign lesions and 307 cancers with higher sureness and maintained lesion-based performance. However, with the LDA there was a notable percentage of benign lesions (42%) with better sureness but lower lesion-based performance.\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nWhen there is no evidence for difference in performance between classifiers using AUC or other performance summary measures, a lesion-based sureness metric may provide additional insight into AI pipeline design. These findings present and emphasize the utility of lesion-based repeatability via sureness in AI/CADx as a complementary enhancement to other evaluation measures.\",\n",

This letter presents a machine-learning approach for infrared gesture recognition. The infrared sensor array employed in this study comprises 16 readout channels, each equipped with a corresponding voltage amplification unit. The sensors are spaced 3 cm apart, while the voltage amplifier consumes 4.77 W. A back propagation (BP) neural network is used to process and classify gesture data.

      "      \"abstract\": \"The concepts of conditional mutual information (CMI) and normalized conditional mutual information (NCMI) are introduced to measure the concentration and separation performance of a classification deep neural network (DNN) in the output probability distribution space of the DNN, where CMI and the ratio between CMI and NCMI represent the intra-class concentration and inter-class separation of the DNN, respectively. By using NCMI to evaluate popular DNNs pretrained over ImageNet in the literature, it is shown that their validation accuracies over ImageNet validation data set are more or less inversely proportional to their NCMI values. Based on this observation, the standard deep learning (DL) framework is further modified to minimize the standard cross entropy function subject to an NCMI constraint, yielding CMI constrained deep learning (CMIC-DL). A novel alternating learning algorithm is proposed to solve such a constrained optimization problem. Extensive experiment results show that DNNs trained within CMIC-DL outperform the state-of-the-art models trained within the standard DL and other loss functions in the literature in terms of both accuracy and robustness against adversarial attacks. In addition, visualizing the evolution of learning process through the lens of CMI and NCMI is also advocated.\",\n",

Our investigation reveals that an orthogonal basis within each multidimensional weight's SVD representation stabilizes during training. Building upon this, we introduce Orthogonality-Informed Adaptive Low-Rank (OIALR) training, a novel training method exploiting the intrinsic orthogonality of neural networks. OIALR seamlessly integrates into existing training workflows with minimal accuracy loss, as demonstrated by benchmarking on various datasets and well-established network architectures. With appropriate hyperparameter tuning, OIALR can surpass conventional training setups, including those of state-of-the-art models.\",\n",

However, their non-Markovian nature arises from the presence of a kernel (leading to so-called Voltera diffusions), which complicates pricing and calibration tasks. In this paper, we present our novel contribution of employing machine learning techniques to either approximate or learn the kernel function in a manner that renders it Markovian, effectively \\u201clifting\\u201d the non-Markovian Volterra diffusion. Through empirical investigations encompassing a diverse set of kernels, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, opening new avenues for improved modelling and analysis in rough volatility models.\",\n",

This research uses 6 types of meat, namely, beef, chicken, lamb, chicken liver, ear mushrooms (A. Auriculla), and oyster mushrooms (P. Ostretatus). The input data used to design the ANN (Artificial Neural Network) architecture is the wavelength and transmittance intensity of each sample type. ANN architecture was designed by creating 1 input layer, 8 hidden layers, and 1 output layer and getting the best results. The ANN classifies the different types of meat so that meat differentiation can be done. Classification gives an accuracy value 72.38% with an epoch of 500. This result is good to be able for distinguish and predict different types of meat. The result shows that ANN can contribute with high accuracy and precision for NIR spectroscopy data.\",\n",
